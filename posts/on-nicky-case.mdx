## Nicky Case

Nicky Case ([@ncasenmare](https://twitter.com/ncasenmare)), found at [ncase.me](https://ncase.me/), makes lots of cool stuff online.

They have a [blog](https://blog.ncase.me/) and you can sign up for a newsletter, but I came across them for their simulations and games.

Try [The Evolution of Trust](https://ncase.me/trust/) or [To Build a Better Ballot: an interactive guide to alternative voting systems](https://ncase.me/ballot/). Or check out all their projects [here](https://ncase.me/projects/).

TODO: See if [nutshell](https://ncase.me/nutshell/) is a good solution for this site. smh why does everything I do lead to more work
