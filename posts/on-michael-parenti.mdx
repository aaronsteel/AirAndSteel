There's much to be said for Parenti. His lectures are short and very easily accessible.

And his history books are some of the first that helped shaped my understanding of history as it occurred. He outlines the perspectives of historical forces well; he demonstrates the incentives at play during some brutal periods of history.

I came to Parenti because of twitter user Aren LeBrun ([@proustmalone](https://twitter.com/proustmalone)). Aren is well-spoken and cutting, and he mentioned that he got much of his insight into the way the world works from reading Parenti. So I decided to put him on the ever-growing list of books-to-read.

While looking for one to read, his most popular book - [The Assassination of Julius Caesar](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37811.The_Assassination_of_Julius_Caesar) - happened to be in an old area of interest. I had a bit of Ancient Rome in the brain already, so I thought it would be a great place to start.

As I was reading, I searched Parenti online. I think I had watched a lecture (or at least some clips) at this point. Online, many recommended [Blackshirts and Reds](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/404273.Blackshirts_and_Reds) as an essential work. I was interested, I've always known my modern history is a weak point, so I read it in a couple hours.

After that, I decided to check out [Inventing Reality](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/673719.Inventing_Reality). This was another really great read that helped me gain clarity on how history went down. Parenti does a great job of pulling relevant newspaper clippings while illustrating the events that occurred.
