This tweet has some solid replies that recommend [The Devil's Chessboard: Allen Dulles, the CIA, and the Rise of America's Secret Government](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24723229-the-devil-s-chessboard) by David Talbot and [Blowback: America's Recruitment of Nazis and Its Destructive Impact on Our Domestic and Foreign Policy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22309161-blowback) by Christopher Simpson. Though the USSR did a good job defeating the Nazis, many of them were well received by capitalist nations.

> Zelenskyy really said he’s going to use Israel as a template for Ukraine. How can anyone who stands with Palestinians see that as anything other than a giant red flag?

> crazy how the sitting president literally exploited 9/11 to manufacture consent to invade a country that had nothing to do with it, setting in motion a multi-decade global “war on terror” where millions were killed for corporate profit, yet somehow that doesn’t qualify as fascist
>
> and he’s trying to sentence a journalist, Julian Assange, to multiple lifetimes in prison for publishing evidence of war crimes done in these wars. but yea totally not a fascist just grandpa biden who loves ice cream
>
> a bit weird how anytime somebody makes the mere suggestion that biden is fascistic suddenly people come in running interference. probably nothing

> so let me get this straight. the US fomented revolt in Ukraine, installed a nazi-aligned regime that systematically erased Russian culture and killed people of the Donbas for 8 yrs, all to goad Putin into a hostile position for pretext to weaken/coup Russia? that right?
>
> also hand in glove, billions laundered to the military industrial complex in the process.
>
> those who have seen events that took place, leak of Nuland’s call, statements by US officials over years (including Biden himself) - know this to be the case, but many who pretend otherwise only do because they’re chauvinists who think US is moral authority of the world.
