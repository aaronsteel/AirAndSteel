> This whole "sex workers enjoy what they do" thing is so dishonest..
>
> Just say you prioritize the experience of (white, western) cam girls rather than survival sex workers of the entire rest of the world. Who cares about women in the global south, right?
>
> In 2012 there was an estimated 42 million prostitutes in the world.

> I don't even think cam girls "enjoy it". All sex work is dehumanizing because the buyers are abusive pos.
>
> The reason that belief is so hard to squash is that the women themselves are forced to pretend like they are enjoying themselves to keep their income.

> 'Libertarian socialism' is almost an oxymoron, as it simultaneously asserts to prioritize both the individual and the collective. A distinctly western an entitled tendency using socialism as a guise for individualism. Which is why it fails time and time again.

> SWERF implies a disdain for sex workers. As an ex-sex worker myself, I can say I only have compassion for all sex workers. And that's precisely why I want the exploitation of women and children here and abroad to end.
>
> An end to sexual slavery, an end to pimps and johns, an end to poverty, an end to rape culture, an end to sex tourism, an end to femicides and missing and murdered indigenous women. It's common sense.

> The thing the US Left does best is anti-communism.

> Americans talk about Uyghurs in Xinjiang as if they care about Muslims LOL
>
> Meanwhile, the US openly deals with Islamic extremism within the Uyghur population by DRONE STRIKING them and Americans are SILENT.

> So funny when STEFS (Sex Trade Expansionist Feminists) tell me to "listen to sex workers" but then I tell them I'm an ex survival sex worker and then they don't know what to do.

> Homelessness and the sex trade are both largely due to poverty and you only see one being reframed by liberals as "empowerment".
>
> There are some people who choose to be homeless but we don't point to them as a justification for homelessness. Poverty alleviation (socialism) is central to alleviation on both fronts.

> Some people see a 50+yo man having sexual relations with a young woman as creepy/predatory until there is a monetary transaction involved. I find this odd.
>
> He asks an 18yo girl to make custom porn or give him a lap dance in the strip club for money and suddenly it's not predatory at all (and the girl is "empowered")! Strange logic.

### Mar 30, 2021 ([src](https://twitter.com/ComradeBrigid/status/1377091199664852993))

> We've gotten to the point that women in porn being raped/abused (verbally and physically) while being double-penetrated and crying is considered normal but speaking against that is considered "sex-negative".
>
> It's astounding how many people are desensitized to this degree of blatant misogyny.

> They really convinced these liberal feminists that patriarchy is feminism :crying emoji:

> > It's empowering to be coerced into producing male orgasm because you're poor.
> - people on twitter

> Prison abolition is not possible until communism. To say traffickers, murderers, and rapists should run free right now for the sake of being a prison abolitionist is a super wild take. Anarchists have weird ideas but also not surprising.
>
> This liberal notion of ultimate individual freedom void of material analysis naturally leads to this.
>
> Good luck shutting down cartel-run child brothels with your food not bombs chapter and a couple volunteer social workers.
>
> This doesn't mean I'm not a prison abolitionist. I am. I've even organized with prison abolition orgs. We held the meetings in my home. I'm just not an idealist-- I'm a materialist.

> The way that pornography has shaped women's beauty standards over the past few decades is actually horrifying.
>
> My heart goes out to all the women in the sex trade who were told they need X operation in order to work, and to all the women who are pressured to conform to these toxic standards of patriarchy and self-loathing.

### Jul 9, 2021 ([src](https://twitter.com/ComradeBrigid/status/1413544570634346496))

> Can you imagine being a communist in the 1960s and after decades of McCarthyism the hippies show up and completely derail Left politics? That must have been so depressing.
>
> Radlibs are the hippies of today. Same bad politics, new optics.
>
> Anti-communist, anti-society, patriarchy but make it ~woke~ repackaged as "sexual liberation", academic anti-working class, utopian socialist nonsense. Hippies V. 2.0

### Jul 23, 2021 ([src](https://twitter.com/ComradeBrigid/status/1418422377436811265))

> Disturbing to know that men watch violent porn and then leave the house and look at you.

### Jul 29, 2021 ([src](https://twitter.com/ComradeBrigid/status/1420794422233604102))

> Universities that charge thousands a semester putting people into debt and then hold seminars for students on "How to be a sex worker 101" should be charged with sex trafficking.

### Aug 20, 2021 ([src](https://twitter.com/ComradeBrigid/status/1428802473666486278))

> *Sex work is work!" is not analysis. It's no wonder that the people who parrot this catchphrase have the weakest materialist analysis on the sex trade. No analysis of class. No analysis of race, sex, and gender demographics. No statistics. Just catchphrases.

### Oct 7, 2021 ([src](https://twitter.com/ComradeBrigid/status/1446190962422714378))

> A dude just told me he'd rather watch porn than have sex with an actual person. This is what happens when our sexualities become commodified by a capitalist industry. This is why society becomes more and more pornified while people are having less actual sex. We're alienated.
>
> Alienated from ourselves, alienated from each other, alienated from the erotic, our sexualities, the sensual, and from connection. Porn kills all of this.

### Dec 2, 2021 ([src](https://twitter.com/ComradeBrigid/status/1466512169504235520))

> Anti-war activism should always be tied to anti-imperialism and should never devolve into pacifism.
