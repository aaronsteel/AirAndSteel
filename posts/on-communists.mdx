> okay I realize now that this is going to become the resource textdump page. because after I started reading communists, well, I haven't stopped. If not communists, then materialists - scientists, engineers, analysts of their crafts. Sure, maybe not everyone I link is a 'communist' technically. Definitely not the ones who are very rich and doing bad things around the globe (ie. `bourgeoisie`). But they have important perspectives to understand (ie. read what they're saying), and here I'll share some of the ones that have shaped my understanding of the world today.

> also worth noting, I still love [art](/posts/on-media). I enjoy [engineering](/posts/on-organizing) and I enjoy all sorts of fun [activities](/posts/on-hobbies). I still read fiction, I love books of all sorts. I love music and movies and the visual arts, I tried to make that clear in [Philosophy I](/posts/on-siddhartha). But for serious reading, for where I'm focused, it's all the materialists of their various fields and fashions.

> And actually, I'm going to break all of these sections down. Kinda geographically, kinda chronologically, kinda based on difficulty to read. I'm trying to keep things as organized as possible, for all our sake's.

Alright, the picture so far. So I know [river is life](/posts/on-siddhartha), blah blah blah. Also I'm tryna be [stoic](/posts/on-meditations) about this whole affair we call life. Maybe both of those thoughts aren't full formed yet, but those were the current most prominent influences.

Then we get to 2020. It's a pandemic (ongoing, wear a mask - N95 or better). The George Floyd protests are ongoing, and I live right on the border of [CHAZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill_Occupied_Protest), a block away from the police station. There was teargas coming in the windows, insane videos were being posted on twitter and reddit of footage from a block away.

I geared up, got protected, saw if I could help in any way possible. I handed out umbrellas I bought cheap, I kept em for the next day when they were left laying around. I held one myself while holding a protective line. Those experienced were (mostly) tired of the capsaicin burn that comes from pepper spray, the coconut oil getting on every surface of my apartment while I tried to heal the redness out; those who were new to the protests didn't seem particularly keen on finding out those intimacies firsthand.

I had batteries, helped keep the megaphones going. Spoke a bit, all voices were hoarse, but I try not to take up too much space - I just went with the usual chants, tried to keep energy and morale up.

I let people in to use the restroom or wash up. I was lucky, with an apartment so close, I tried to help those who needed protection. Especially when the chemical weapons came out.

The teargas. Man the fucking teargas. "_There goes Aaron again, talking about the time he got teargassed_" they say. Yeah! I'm not over all the fucking teargas. *WHY*, let's think for a minute, keep up with me, just for a second, *WHY DO THE COPS HAVE SO MUCH FUCKING TEARGAS AND WHY ARE THEY DEPLOYING IT ON CIVILIANS? WHY ARE THEY PEPPER SPRAYING LITTLE CHILDREN? BLINDING PEOPLE WITH RUBBER BULLETS THAT ARE MEANT TO BE SHOT AT FEET?* Unstopped, unchecked, much too often. Funded to the sky.

And people are starting to see the problem more clearly than ever before. The kids are, the ones on twitter and tiktok. They're making attempts to make change when they can.

Okay, where were we, teargas. Yes. At the time, I was working and experiencing protest, power in the street, firsthand. I was experiencing the state repression against that protest at the same exact time. I was like Marx observing the Paris Commune, I was coming to the same natural understanding of history that he had. I was seeing [the river](/posts/on-siddhartha) and I was [finding my place](/posts/on-meditations).

The first book that really kicked off this journey, during this era of aforementioned teargassing, on recommendation from another good friend, was [Confessions of an Economic Hit Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man) by John Perkins. That book got me thinking about my own role within society, about the parallels I could draw between my life and his explanations of history.

TODO Here: probably outline modern resources that helped the most.

RedSails, Aren LeBrun, useful twitter accounts, TANKIEPILLED, etc.

Link to efforts that they're doing and how they relate to other articles here.

Then, explain that we're starting with the US because that's what I know. That's what I've seen the most of, that's where I've been.

This is a compilation of reading recommendations, organized by topic. I've read all these (sometimes only partially, for works I trust)

If you want to learn:



[Reading (ie. Books and Articles)]

# the best, imo:

On Dialectics (many, but esp [NiaFrome](https://redsails.org/on-dialectics/)). probably need my own, gdi.

probably also need the starter list of lenin/stalin/einstein/engels, maybe link RedPrintsPub/MLRH.
