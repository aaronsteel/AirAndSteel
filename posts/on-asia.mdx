## Asia (with a focus on Korea, China, and Vietnam)

For Korean perspective on Socialism, check out a bunch of Kim Il-Sung's speeches [here](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60734264-socialist-education-in-korea). There's a reason he's a hero of the people, he has valuable perspective to share as a guerilla leader.



TODO: quote, che, everyone arrives at marxism through observing nature and drawing their own conclusions
TODO: quote, Korean/Cuban about the shared stuggle
TODO: Pachinko
TODO: Vietnam / Ho. RedSails, how I arrived at the third international (ie. which was the party that stood against imperialism. eventually understanding Lenin's words. pull quote, also link.)
TODO: Laos

Continuing on from Korea but staying within Asia (and also suffering under the outward expansion of Imperial Japan), China!

- Zhou Enlai
- Deng

### Xinjiang Atrocity Propaganda Blitz - Feb 25, 2021 ([src](https://twitter.com/justinpodur/status/1365072793214349317))

Justin Podur ([@justinpodur](https://twitter.com/justinpodur)) notes,

> It is important that China be presented as genocidal so that if you say "it's possible to eliminate poverty" or "it's possible to contain COVID in 2 months" the reply can be "lol Xinjiang" and the conversation is over.
>
> Many more people died of COVID in long-term care facilities in Canada than died in the whole pandemic in China.

That isn't even getting to the real starts. For that, we'd have to get Europe, to Marx. Following the Paris Commune, in Germany. Then Lenin, in Russia. Working hard and coming up with the Leninism part of the Marxism-Leninism. His four works are essential. And finally, Stalin, the synthesizer of Marxism-Leninism.

To move forward, we'll go back to the "start": Europe time, let's talk about [Germany and Russia](/posts/on-europe)
