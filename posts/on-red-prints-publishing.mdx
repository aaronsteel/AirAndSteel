## DengistDuck

I was introduced to all of these efforts via twitter. Comrade Duck ([@DengistDuck](https://twitter.com/DengistDuck)), a [CPUSA](cpusa.org/join) member based in Laos who helped with the creation of MLRH and RPP; the reason I know about all the good work being done in the first place! Keep it up, comrade.

I'm also including a few tweets of theirs

> It's not normal to see a deadly virus infecting, harming, and killing our country and the first response to be to send more people into harms way. The only reason that people even think an idea like this is good is because they're conditioned to a society where its sink or swim
>
> China does not have to face these issues we are seeing now in the states. Why not?
>
> Because China cares about their people. They lockdown and isolate COVID, they take it seriously. When people need to be locked down and isolated, the government sends them food and resources. They value lives above the rich and profits.
>
> It is so cartoonish that all of the death and suffering we are seeing was easily avoidable, but our capitalist society forces us to keep the cogs turning for the sake of profit.
>
> And our population is conditioned to believe that the profit we are forced to generate is for our benefit when its not. Not only is it not for our benefit, it is literally killing us.
>
> 800,000+ dead. 1 Million new cases in one day. In a single day, we have had 1200.6% more cases than China (mainland) has had cumulative in the entire course of COVID.
We don't have to live in a society that forces us to die for the rich. Our government is not for us, and no amount of voting will ever fix that. China, and the rest of the Communist governments in the world, show us that there is a solution. Socialism is the only answer to this disgusting problem that we are facing today.

> Honestly, if you're in the West, your primary objective at this moment is to stop your country from pushing war. It is your responsibility to push anti-War propaganda to your friends, family, and community. It is your responsibility to organize around this issue.
>
> Your principal contradiction has shifted.

> Every single person, including communists, who lives in the empire has an internal struggle with chauvinism. 
>
> This chauvinism doesn't magically stop when you become a communist and it can't stop as long as the empire lives.
>
> It is important for the communist movement within the empire to recognize this contradiction and to not think we are ever above this contradiction.
>
> To ignore it will lead to chauvinist errors and lead us further away from true internationalism.
>
> We must always consider our chauvinism and how it has/is affecting our decisions. We must actively oppose chauvinism within ourselves just as we speak against outwardly. 
>
> This contradiction will always exist until the empire no longer exists and we must be mindful of it.

> Nothing has made me prouder of CPUSA recently than the role they played in unionization efforts of Amazon in NY.
>
> When AOC showed who she was and abandoned their struggle, the communists were there. And the communists will always be there for the people.
>
> This is the mass line in practice

> Socialism in Laos - Kaysone Phomvihane ThoughtðŸ§µ
>
> Although the term "Kaysone Phomvihane Thought" was not established until the 10th Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP) National Congress, it refers to the Lao application of Marxism-Leninism current and before the 10th congress
>
> Important Context:
>
> The Lao people had been oppressed for centuries and the most recent and well-known, the colonial and neo-colonial efforts of the French and U.S.
> 
> When the Great October Socialist Revolution occurred, it sparked a wave of revolutionary fervor across the world.
> 
> Revolutionary movements around the world were often viewed as three distinct revolutionary movements:
>
> 1) The Socialist system
> 2) National Liberation
> 3) International Labor movement in the Capitalist nations
>
> The Great October Socialist Revolution united these distinct revolutionary movements, drawing millions of people towards socialism, and inspiring even more people to fight for liberation - the Lao people were among these people to fight for liberation and socialism.
>
> At this point, I am not going to go further in depth of the history from 1900-1970 because it is a lot of information to get lost in. But the influence/role of the USSR in worldwide revolutionary struggle is important to highlight.
>
> The LPRP had lead the masses in the efforts of bucking off: first, the French colonial system in 1953; second, bucked off the neo-colonial French system in the 1960's; third, bucked off the American imperialists, freeing the Lao people finally in 1975.
>
> This victory of this resistance took its toll. Many know about the US "Secret War" in Laos, but the US did more than take lives, it crippled the development of a country that had few resources to begin with.
>
> Article that talks highlights the death toll: [The Secret War: US Terror in Laos (via mounttai.press)](https://www.mounttai.press/articles/the-secret-war-us-terror-in-laos)
>
> On top of being a new fledgling country from a semi-feudal background, the US bombed Lao farm lands, industry, people, etc... Those that survived risked their lives to rebuild, simple tasks as rice farming could prove fatal thanks to the UXO's as mentioned in the article above.
>
> The "international economy" (led by the US) turned its back on Laos because of its dedication to Socialism under the LPRP. Though not completely alone, the Lao people had the support of the socialist bloc
>
> The landscape for socialist construction, to put it frankly, is *ROUGH*
>
> As established by the Second National Party Congress in 1972, the LPRP set in motion the plan of "direct transition to socialism bypassing capitalism."
>
> As 1972 was before national liberation, this was not fully expanded upon at the time. In 1986 the LPRP CC held the 4th Plenum of the LPRP CC established the socialist transitional period in Laos as: 
>
> "The establishment and consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the right of the working people to be the collective master of the country, together with the simultaneous achievement of three revolutions: 
> 
> 1) revolution in the sphere of production relations,
> 2) revolution in the sphere of science and technology,
> 3) revolution in the sphere of ideology and culture.
> 
> In this process, the scientific-technological revolution plays the key role, and the cultural-ideological revolution must keep one step ahead of the other two."
> 
> This quote is the most important thing to understand when discussing Kaysone Phomvihane Thought. These three revolutions.
>
> Here we see a clear statement that material conditions are the primary contradiction in Lao Socialist construction while Marxism-Leninism is the guiding ideology (cultural-ideological revolution staying one step ahead).
> 
> In 1989, with the collapse of the USSR approaching, Laos opens up its economy, but the Party journal still emphasizes the material conditions within the transitional period:
> 
> "Previously, we defined the basic struggle in our socialist country as a two-line struggle between socialism and capitalism and argued that with the transition to socialism, we had to resolve this struggle and a struggle between collective ownership and private ownership... This [is] a misunderstanding... Considering the current socio-economic situation in our country, the most fundamental struggle [to resolve] is the one between old-fashioned forces of production and increasing production to supply the demand in society that is increasing daily."
> 
> Few years later, the USSR completely collapses. Socialist countries' primary support vanishes and pressure on all socialist countries greatly increases
> 
> Although external relations changed greatly because of the collapse of the USSR, the primary contradictions within Laos did not - their task was to still construct socialism. Without the USSR, this forced Laos to reconsider how to survive on the world stage. Having followed a similar path to that of China and Vietnam, Laos opened up its economy - an economy that allowed foreign and national private investment, while under the careful watch and heavy hand of the LPRP (remaining a dictatorship of the proletariat).
> 
> This opening up allowed for the scientific-technological revolution, that which the Party deems as the key role, to make great strides, despite the collapse of the USSR, while still maintaining the cultural-ideological revolution under the guide of the Party.
> 
> The cultural-ideological revolution has taken a blow since the collapse of the USSR, but has still stayed ahead of the other two.
> 
> Funding and guidance for building socialist superstructure fell drastically without the USSR. To see some examples: https://jstor.org/stable/43738032
> 
> The production relations revolution is more dynamic than some might expect. As mentioned before, Laos began socialist construction directly from being a semi-feudal colony.
> 
> In contrast to countries like the US, class relations is much more complex.
> 
> There remained many classes left over from the the semi-feudal time. Transforming these classes to proletariat is not as simple as it sounds and it takes time; especially with an economy that is not a powerhouse.
> 
> The LPRP works towards this challenge through "model villages"
> 
> you can read a book about it here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X9-5KS2JxOmOgiZlflefc9NVjyA5IHTj/view?usp=sharing
> 
> Hopefully this thread is insightful to Kaysone Phomvihane Thought and Socialist construction in Laos.

> Laos: we tried the path of a completely socialized economy, but that didn't work. With our people remaining extremely poor and the USSR collapsing, we were left 2 options - stay closed off from the world market and starve; or adapt market reforms under Party control
>
> Idealist Communists: LOL you revisionist idiots!! If I was in charge, I simply would have starved the people. I don't care if the Party leadership has led you out of being in the Least Developed Country category. Only the revolution that is *pure* gets my support.
