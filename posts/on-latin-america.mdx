Coming from the [North Americas](/posts/on-north-america).

## Latin America (with a focus on Cuba)

Branching out from the US, hmm, let's see. For Cuba, there's [Che](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara) and Fidel. I love [Che Guevara Talks to Young People](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/405935.Che_Guevara_Talks_to_Young_People) - I reference it heavily in [On Technology](/posts/on-technology). For a quick Cuban piece, check out [On the Ideology of the Cuban Revolution (1960)](https://redsails.org/la-ideologia-de-la-revolucion-cubana/) by Che. Or, here are a couple longer interviews by Fidel: [One](https://redsails.org/fidel-and-gawronski/), [two](https://redsails.org/fidel-in-guadalajara/). Oh, and when you get there, the most important for me: [Guerilla Warfare](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6739402-guerilla-warfare) by Che. About the real logistics of [organizing](/posts/on-organizing) his troops, what it took to fight those battles, all the real-life little details that matter.

As they report in Havana, [there's a great friendship between cuba and north korea](https://havanatimes.org/news/the-great-friendship-between-cuba-and-north-korea/). Their struggles are one and the same, against imperialism. They have fought the same battles. Survived the same attack, steely peoples the both of them. Enjoying life; fighting hard to keep doing that.

TODO: Bolivia, Venezuela, oh, right, literally all of Latin America other than Cuba.
