title: On The Fall of Twitter

## Huh?

Well. It's November 4th. Twitter has just gone through a major round of layoffs, as have a few other companies while they can escape scrutiny.

As [@Foone](https://twitter.com/Foone) says [here](https://twitter.com/Foone/status/1588429889107296256?t=r5XrHQb2-Hn5GMwpZo2vPw&s=19):

> As a former SRE, I'd just like to say:
This site isn't going to burn down. That's way too calm and organized a death for a site this big which apparently just fired most of the on-call staff.
>
> That's more like it.
> It's going to evaporate, not like a puddle on a hot day, but like a couple tons of steel that's just met an atomic shockwave
>
> We're going to need high speed cameras to even see the blast as anything more than a single frame of white and then devastation as far as the eye can see.
>
> This site is going to melt.
>
> It's actually funny in retrospect how people have been talking about how the changes to verification and unbanning certain people is going to drive people off Twitter as they lose trust in the platform...
>
> It's not going to last long enough for that to even matter!
>
> This is a great example of what's going to happen. It's not going to get hacked or have servers catch fire, but something small and unexpected is going to take it down and they'll be unable to find someone to unfuck it:
> > Right now a disk is filling up on a server somewhere in some data center that a person who has just been laid off has been manually clearing every few days and when that disk fills up Twitter will go down.

So I'm trying to get all my useful info and links off of there before they're lost forever. Why does it always feel like I'm racing against time trying to build as things crumble? Anyway.

TODO: sort these into the relevant articles, tags, everything, organize, organize, organize all the resources

To start, this maybe isn't related specifically to twitter, but I feel it's relevant. From Dan Waterfield ([@danwaterfield](https://twitter.com/danwaterfield)) [here](https://twitter.com/danwaterfield/status/1587900573055082497?t=VxaVVQkBABheS2w9kwjQyg&s=19):

> I would argue that this is what state collapse looks like btw. A slow inability to build new things, to look after the populace, to repair infrastructure. Essentials get more expensive. The elite retreat to enclaves and gated communities.
>
> State becomes less and less able to respond to natural disasters.

I think that's applicable enough to the twitter situation, though I'm not sure that's what Dan was originally referencing. If/when twitter falls, there is no recourse. Under private ownership, with a lack of regulation or accountability, we can lose millions of hours of community time, thought, and effort. Just because the richest guy around wanted to meme around and buy a website, wreak havoc on the workers for a little good time.

We (see: [On Uniting](/posts/on-uniting)) need to be building and maintaining our own infrastructure, in order to prevent it from being destroyed at the whim of those at the top.

For right now I'm being a bit of a modern librarian on my silly little site. I am trying to salvage and reclaim, in this moment. But we need to build systems for the people, and we need to have been building em 20 years ago. The only time is now.

## more tweets about twitter

jfc these are making me sad and anxious. I'm saving them here because I feel powerless to do anything else.

### Social Media is not optional - Nov 4, 2022

From Robert Brockaway ([@brockway_llc](https://twitter.com/brockway_llc), [linktree](https://linktr.ee/brockwar)) [here](https://twitter.com/brockway_llc/status/1588556831731126272):

> This is where I get the word out about my stuff, where I meet other writers, where I find and book podcast guests. I don't have this following anywhere else, and there's no other place to do this.
>
> I know the cool thing to do is be glad its dying because it spites some dipshit billionaire, but this meaningfully harms my professional life in a serious way.
>
> I quit Facebook because it strangled reach and, y'know, murdered my entire industry. That left most of my social media reach through this platform - what should it have been, TikTok, Instagram? They're not designed for writers and connecting like this. Also: Both equally evil.
>
> Social media is not optional for a working creative these days, it factors into everything you do from podcast sales to book deals. You have to do something, and for people like me: This was it. There was and is not a meaningful alternative.
>
> So it's weird to have this huge pit of anxiety and despair over fucking social media, but I just watched a tantrum-throwing baby drive a tank through my workplace and I'm wondering how the hell I'm going to recover from it.
>
> One thing that's been proven time and again is that an audience is an incredibly fragile thing. This goes away and 95% of my followers -- even engaged ones, people that buy my books, will drift away too.
>
> It's up to me to try to move that audience elsewhere before this dies, but again -- to where? This is it, and any alternative is going to see massive hemorrhage.

### Losing a 90K-person platform - Nov 4, 2022

Summer Brennan ([@summerbrennan](https://twitter.com/summerbrennan)) who writes on substack [here](https://summerbrennan.substack.com/) puts it more concisely:

> Oh yeah as an underemployed writer, I'm totally fine with losing a 90K-person platform built up over thirteen years, when I am otherwise not remotely famous, why do you ask?

### Unions

I posted a tweet by Anne V Clark wrt twitter and unionization in [On Unions](/posts/on-unions) if you want to check out that related content.

### Hot Potato'd - Nov 5, 2022 - ([src](https://twitter.com/The_Law_Boy/status/1589028354824736769))

From Peter, [@The_Law_Boy](https://twitter.com/The_Law_Boy) of [5-4 Pod](https://www.fivefourpod.com/):

> lots of frustration being directed at elon but it's also pretty weird that the twitter board just hot potato'd the company onto a dude who clearly did not actually want to own it
>
> there's something so bleak about developing a platform for 15 years and then just cashing out as soon as you can get a 30% premium or whatever. shareholder primacy creates these moments of complete detachment from the need to actually make something useful or good
>
> many repliers very proud of themselves for knowing the basic contours of corporate law here rather than grasping the actual point which is that corporate law is dumb

## z-lib

In the vein of failing infrastructure, I also just heard of the fall of z-lib. From [@juwugoslavija](https://twitter.com/juwugoslavija) [here](https://twitter.com/juwugoslavija/status/1588486265301008384?t=2VUfnbXV5yoW5ovbd2OgXw&s=19)

> z library being gone is literally the worst day ever why am i abt to cry at jfk international airport

From [@postcardofexile](https://twitter.com/postcardofexile) on [this](https://twitter.com/postcardofexile/status/1588516388137709569?t=21y8G7pUrmCtF8wDE9PLXw&s=19) post:

> Zlibrary died today, it was shut down by the gatekeepers in the global north. This cruel gatekeeping of sources of knowledge and learning enrages me. So many of us do not have access to libraries (digital and physical) and it was our only source to write books and articles.
>
> Whenever books are not available at my local stores, I had turned to Zlib. I understand as a writer we need royalties and payments, but the joy of hearing someone say that a writing made them feel something, I would take that over anything. I would rather be read and read.
>
> knowledge production should not be limited to those with ivy league and oxbridge degrees, and the libraries these schools give access to. this enrages me because curiosity to learn and question critically is then shut down. Narratives will narrow down and voices limited.
>
> There are so many books that I couldn’t have read while writing this novel, and were only available on these libraries. How do they expect anyone in the global south to compete with novelists who have art grants, access to residencies, and libraries, mentors and archives.

and as many have said, including [@mshadimas](https://twitter.com/mshadimas) [here](https://twitter.com/mshadimas/status/1588417930630684672):

> zlib going down is like the modern day burning of the library of alexandria

Again, may we collect our materials and rebuild our resources. There's so much work to be done.

## Alec Karakatsanis

[@equalityAlec](https://twitter.com/equalityAlec), bio [here](https://civilrightscorps.org/alec-karakatsanis-founder-executive-director/) on his site Civil Rights Corp.

He's had a few good threads, so I'm keeping this as a tracker to remember his writing and work.

> [THREAD](https://twitter.com/equalityAlec/status/1584570222274842624?t=tcRyT7W_xpx1pp5fZF4wpg&s=19).  This weekend, the New York Times published misinformation it knew to be false. Because the stakes are so high, I try my best to explain what the paper did why it is so dangerous.

> [THREAD](https://twitter.com/equalityAlec/status/1588210962867314689?t=ap1BwHhUCvqQoNg4pRBtbw&s=19). Two Harvard professors published an academic article calling for 500,000 more armed cops, who they say will arrest 7.8 million more people per year. The article reveals alarming flaws in elite academia at a time of rising fascism. This is one of my most important posts.

## Community, Uniting, Organizing

### Rebuild Community - Oct 24, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/goodfriendraf/status/1584526316165943297))

This is just a thought I like to consider, from rafael diaz ([@goodfriendraf](https://twitter.com/goodfriendraf))

> can’t help but feel more and more convinced that we’re so alienated from one another that we need to take on serious efforts just to rebuild community itself before we’re able to get much out of trying to organize it

### What does organization look like? - Nov 6, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/Casswantsrevolt/status/1589312784655060994))

From Communist Anarchist Society Saboteur (C.A.S.S.) ([@Casswantsrevolt](https://twitter.com/Casswantsrevolt)):

> As a lot of people realize the need for arming up against fascist violence, a lot buy a gun and think they're good
>
> This is a mistake
>
> A single person with a gun can protect themselves against immediate violence, but they will not be able to protect themselves against the fascist movement as a whole.
>
> for that you need to be organized. But what does being organized look like?
>
> First things first, you need to find people you trust and form a group.
>
> This might seem hard  to do in our atomized world but we need to do it. Talk to your neighbors and find likeminded people, show up in your friends and comrades lives, connect and network.
>
> after you have a group you can trust, start training together. Drills, dry fire, exercise, rucking, hiking, first aid, small unit tactics etc. Train together and have fun with it. Do fun shit together to build trust. Have movie nights, potlucks, and BBQ's
>
> And for the gods sake, help your community.
>
> start a food not bombs, organize a community pantry, build a community garden. Host art and other fun events. Check up on your neighbors, repair houses, do disaster relief, start a cop watch, help train and protect the marginalized
>
> if you don't help your community, you're just a group of people with guns. With an organized community, you can do force multiplication that will help you immensely against fascist threats. A majority of your group's actions should be helping your community
>
> Another thing your group should do, intelligence. Find and dox fascists in your area. Walk, bike, skate, and drive around to learn about the layout of your area. keep an eye on local politics and fascist group's actions. Find out which people and group in your area are
>
> sympathetic, apathetic, or hostile. Network and connect with other groups in your area and work together. Learn where security cameras are Practice good security culture and PERSEC.
>
> But the major thing to prevent is yourself and your group from being filled with machismo. Your main goal isn't to be the most badass revolutionary and go out in a blaze of glory, its to help your community and survive another day. Don't be tough, be caring.
>
> Remember, if we wait for the governments, it’ll be too little, too late; if we act as individuals, it’ll be too little; but if we act as communities, it might just be enough, just in time.

> Communists, Marxist—Leninists, need to realize or admit that they are absolutely by no means "leftists."  The Left—Right political spectrum is a bourgeois liberal construct that has no basis in reality.  The Communist political spectrum is Oppressed—Oppressor.
>
> The US ytleft is a sticky, bubbling soup of anticommunist reaction, hedonism, chauvinism, anti-intellectualism, moralism, pacifism, idealism, liberalism, imperial apologists and anarchists.  Screw that.
>
> Communists need to find the *victims of capitalism,* at the farthest margins of society and begin crafting a massline while engaging in mutual aid; there's no shortage of partywork here, so why are we the materialists affiliating in any way with Chomskyites and neo-Bernsteinians?

> Anybody remember that house in Milwaukee that the police were absolutely using to hold teenage girls they kidnapped for sex trafficking and then immediately burned down once everybody figured out what was going on and we like... Just stopped talking about?

> People here aren't "falling for" CIA ops in Cuba — they support US imperialism, the return of the plantation system in Cuba; its relapse to a labor camp for agricultural extraction.  Stop treating liberals like drooling babies who don't know what their own politics and goals are.
>
> The liberals have been salivating for control over Cuba since the 1800s; Jefferson supported its annexation openly.  They see it as manifest destiny, but to the east; trying to acquire it since the Polk administration.  The ideology of white supremacy long demands this expansion.
>
> Liberals can't stand to see a tropical paradise a mere 90 miles away that has so successfully rejected their hegemony, and they will tolerate nothing less than full ideological and economic control over the island.

> Call me crazy, but I think Communists should recruit people into the Communist movement by explaining Communist ideas, not by assuring reactionaries it's a safe space for their backwards, incorrect ideas.

> I don't know what is so confusing about this (well, yes I do: y'all don't fuсkin' read) but "imperialism" is an arrangement of political economy; a development of capitalism — not defined by the "vibes" of a geopolitical conflict, or your fetishistic attraction to "underdogs."
>
> For instance, the US invasion of Iraq itself was a crime, a violation of international law but the INVASION was not the imperialist part.  The imperialism came when Iraq's agriculture was gutted and Monsanto was given carte blanche over that sector, among many, many other things.
>
> You could say the invasion as a verb was imperialist people enacting those imperialist economic mechanisms in agriculture, energy etc was the outset, if mostly unspoken goal ...
>
> ... but if you want to designate Russia imperialist for whatever reason at this juncture, you'd have to prove that motive.
>
> Good luck.

## Climate and Energy

### Climate Collapse - Oct 22, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/MarxistHeathen/status/1583924752921468929))

A thread made by HeathenCommunist ([@MarxistHeathen](https://twitter.com/MarxistHeathen)), a CPUSA member in Arizona:

> Climate collapse is not one issue among many or another social ill that we need to defeat capitalism before dealing with. Before anything and everything else: it’s deadline.
>
> Shifting our focus to it isn’t about making it the most important “issue”. It’s not an “issue”.
>
> It’s a material condition that MUST shape the *entirety* of our strategy like a frame. That doesn’t mean we talk about it more than anything else. It just means it’s always on our mind when strategizing, even if we don’t say it.
>
> What does revolution mean when it’s not just a matter of liberation but total survival?
>
> What do scientific socialism and experimentation mean when we no longer have the time to “try again”?
>
> What does it mean for internal contradictions among our enemy when *they* know this and *they* know that working with us to actually defeat the other camp be defeated by us would be their death sentence?
>
> What does it mean for revolutionary strategy when asking the question of “how can we accomplish this” is an obsolete question, replaced by “how can we accomplish this in time”?
>
> What does it mean when we can’t afford another setback? When we can’t afford another century of struggle?
>
> What does it mean when believing revolution won’t happen in our lifetime stops being the planting of trees whose shade we will never sit under & is now accepting that our grandchildren will have no shade to sit in?
>
> Historical socialist strategy was premised on laying the groundwork for future struggle when it could not find a way to achieve its aims.
>
> How do we cope with the fact that we *are* that future generation that groundwork was laid for? That, if we can’t find a way to achieve our aims, that our only option is to keep looking until we find it?

> Every day I handle more money than I will ever make. Every day.
>
> At the start of my employment, my boss showed me videos of people stealing, and we both had a chuckle about it. How silly they were! There was a camera overhead. and it's not to watch the shoppers. See, we can't actually stop shoplifters. They get away with it maybe nine out of ten times. But we, who are all watched and tallied and witnessed? We are always caught.
>
> At first it was hard to hold one hundred dollar bills. An amount I had never seen before. An amount that didn't exist in my household. It's normal now. Here is something that is not for me.
>
> 'What the hell, I'll take another,' says the man, pondering out 200 dollar watches. What the hell. Total comes to 580 and not even a flinch in his face. I have been working for 11 hours today and made only 110 dollars. It will go to my rent. Today I work for free, it feels. When I get my check, I will have 35 dollars left for food and saving.
>
> The six hundreds he hands me go into the cash register. For a moment, I imagine having money. Then I put it away, counting out his change.
>
> I know for a fact we sell out products for double what they are worth. That I could be making commission. That they could hand me those 580 dollars and change my life and not even mark the difference in their checkbooks. He's not the only sale they make today, but I am the reason they made it. He's not the only one spending 600 dollars, but if I hadn't spent two hours with him telling me about his life, he wouldn't have spent any. I go home. I don't own a watch.
>
> I have watched and rewatched a video on how to make salmon four ways. My shopping list is always the same. Pasta. Rice. Tuna. If I can afford butter it was a good week. I dream of the world I will never walk in, where I can throw the best fish fillet in the cart with a shrug. I hold hundreds in my hand and look up at the camera. I put them under the cash drawer.
>
> I go to work. I scrap together my savings. I eat my bowl of rice slowly. My manager takes a paid week off from work just for this birthday. He owns a yacht.
>
> I'm not worth the cost of a watch.
