title: On The Fall of Twitter

## Huh?

Well. It's November 4th. Twitter has just gone through a major round of layoffs, as have a few other companies while they can escape scrutiny.

As [@Foone](https://twitter.com/Foone) says [here](https://twitter.com/Foone/status/1588429889107296256?t=r5XrHQb2-Hn5GMwpZo2vPw&s=19):

> As a former SRE, I'd just like to say:
This site isn't going to burn down. That's way too calm and organized a death for a site this big which apparently just fired most of the on-call staff.
>
> That's more like it.
> It's going to evaporate, not like a puddle on a hot day, but like a couple tons of steel that's just met an atomic shockwave
>
> We're going to need high speed cameras to even see the blast as anything more than a single frame of white and then devastation as far as the eye can see.
>
> This site is going to melt.
>
> It's actually funny in retrospect how people have been talking about how the changes to verification and unbanning certain people is going to drive people off Twitter as they lose trust in the platform...
>
> It's not going to last long enough for that to even matter!
>
> This is a great example of what's going to happen. It's not going to get hacked or have servers catch fire, but something small and unexpected is going to take it down and they'll be unable to find someone to unfuck it:
> > Right now a disk is filling up on a server somewhere in some data center that a person who has just been laid off has been manually clearing every few days and when that disk fills up Twitter will go down.

So I'm trying to get all my useful info and links off of there before they're lost forever. Why does it always feel like I'm racing against time trying to build as things crumble? Anyway.

TODO: sort these into the relevant articles, tags, everything, organize, organize, organize all the resources

To start, this maybe isn't related specifically to twitter, but I feel it's relevant. From Dan Waterfield ([@danwaterfield](https://twitter.com/danwaterfield)) [here](https://twitter.com/danwaterfield/status/1587900573055082497?t=VxaVVQkBABheS2w9kwjQyg&s=19):

> I would argue that this is what state collapse looks like btw. A slow inability to build new things, to look after the populace, to repair infrastructure. Essentials get more expensive. The elite retreat to enclaves and gated communities.
>
> State becomes less and less able to respond to natural disasters.

I think that's applicable enough to the twitter situation, though I'm not sure that's what Dan was originally referencing. If/when twitter falls, there is no recourse. Under private ownership, with a lack of regulation or accountability, we can lose millions of hours of community time, thought, and effort. Just because the richest guy around wanted to meme around and buy a website, wreak havoc on the workers for a little good time.

We (see: [On Uniting](/posts/on-uniting)) need to be building and maintaining our own infrastructure, in order to prevent it from being destroyed at the whim of those at the top.

For right now I'm being a bit of a modern librarian on my silly little site. I am trying to salvage and reclaim, in this moment. But we need to build systems for the people, and we need to have been building em 20 years ago. The only time is now.

## z-lib

In the vein of failing infrastructure, I also just heard of the fall of z-lib. From [@juwugoslavija](https://twitter.com/juwugoslavija) [here](https://twitter.com/juwugoslavija/status/1588486265301008384?t=2VUfnbXV5yoW5ovbd2OgXw&s=19)

> z library being gone is literally the worst day ever why am i abt to cry at jfk international airport

From [@postcardofexile](https://twitter.com/postcardofexile) on [this](https://twitter.com/postcardofexile/status/1588516388137709569?t=21y8G7pUrmCtF8wDE9PLXw&s=19) post:

> Zlibrary died today, it was shut down by the gatekeepers in the global north. This cruel gatekeeping of sources of knowledge and learning enrages me. So many of us do not have access to libraries (digital and physical) and it was our only source to write books and articles.
>
> Whenever books are not available at my local stores, I had turned to Zlib. I understand as a writer we need royalties and payments, but the joy of hearing someone say that a writing made them feel something, I would take that over anything. I would rather be read and read.
>
> knowledge production should not be limited to those with ivy league and oxbridge degrees, and the libraries these schools give access to. this enrages me because curiosity to learn and question critically is then shut down. Narratives will narrow down and voices limited.
>
> There are so many books that I couldn’t have read while writing this novel, and were only available on these libraries. How do they expect anyone in the global south to compete with novelists who have art grants, access to residencies, and libraries, mentors and archives.

and as many have said, including [@mshadimas](https://twitter.com/mshadimas) [here](https://twitter.com/mshadimas/status/1588417930630684672):

> zlib going down is like the modern day burning of the library of alexandria

Again, may we collect our materials and rebuild our resources. There's so much work to be done.

## Alec Karakatsanis

[@equalityAlec](https://twitter.com/equalityAlec), bio [here](https://civilrightscorps.org/alec-karakatsanis-founder-executive-director/) on his site Civil Rights Corp.

He's had a few good threads, so I'm keeping this as a tracker to remember his writing and work.

> [THREAD](https://twitter.com/equalityAlec/status/1584570222274842624?t=tcRyT7W_xpx1pp5fZF4wpg&s=19).  This weekend, the New York Times published misinformation it knew to be false. Because the stakes are so high, I try my best to explain what the paper did why it is so dangerous.

> [THREAD](https://twitter.com/equalityAlec/status/1588210962867314689?t=ap1BwHhUCvqQoNg4pRBtbw&s=19). Two Harvard professors published an academic article calling for 500,000 more armed cops, who they say will arrest 7.8 million more people per year. The article reveals alarming flaws in elite academia at a time of rising fascism. This is one of my most important posts.

## Community and Uniting

This is just a thought I like to consider, from rafael diaz ([@goodfriendraf](https://twitter.com/goodfriendraf))

> can’t help but feel more and more convinced that we’re so alienated from one another that we need to take on serious efforts just to rebuild community itself before we’re able to get much out of trying to organize it

## Trans Topics

### desistence therapy

From Elaine Scattermoon's ([@scattermoon](https://twitter.com/scattermoon)'s) thread [here](https://twitter.com/scattermoon/status/1584116431255638016?t=MM2Hl67O23NqC_4KTDF-Ng&s=19):

> OK Twitter, I need to talk to you about the harmful version of conversion therapy I went through a teen - something called 'desistence therapy', which was basically gaslighting of a young teen into not only not transitioning but believing that not transitioning was their idea.
>
> What's worse is that this was done to me not by a shady illicit private business but by a NHS Gender Clinic. They forced me to undergo the wrong puberty, with me begging them to prevent it, and tried to convince me that it was what I really wanted all along, and it broke me.
>
> I've been wanting to make this thread for a while but every time I went to write it, I froze up, because it still has such a lasting impact on me even two decades later. I've been scared to talk about it, the effect it had on me, what it did to me. It's genuinely traumatic.
>
> But I've learned that nobody seems to know it even happened here in the UK. I've met nobody who went through the same thing - at least this side of the Atlantic - and I feel that there needs to be some record of it, a testimony from someone who went through it in the UK in 2000s.
>
> Not just as a personal record - finally putting this out there to get it out of my head - but also so that there's awareness that it happened, what it does to young people, and why it must NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN anywhere. Why 'desistence' is so incredibly harmful and outright abusive
>
> I've always met trans people my age - mid-30s now - who tell me they wish they'd known they were trans earlier in their lives, before puberty did its damage, and I have to stop myself snapping at them in response, because I did, and it only led me into denial and gaslighting.
>
> I realised I was trans very early for someone my age. I won't give you the full backstory but I was a nerdy kid who did her research and I was able to piece things together from various Internet resources and medical records around 2001. I was in my early teens still then.
>
> Eventually I plucked up the courage to speak to my GP. Who didn't know what to do with me and had to look it up. Mostly it involved in him examining my teenage genitals - I know - and referring me on to a GIC. Given my age it should have been the Tavistock in London. It wasn't.
>
> Instead I was referred to my local GIC, which I won't name here. Waiting lists back then were nowhere near where they were now, but they were still in the terms of many months, with something like half a year between appointments. This will become very important.
>
> At that point, I was still very lucky. I'd barely had any effects of puberty yet, and I felt there was a good chance I could avoid it altogether, get the right puberty for me with the changes I wanted, rather than the male ones I dreaded and deeply feared.
>
> I knew puberty blockers were a thing - despite what media now may claim, they're not new, and even back then they were in use for trans teens in the Netherlands. I thought maybe I could convince the doctors to save me. That maybe I'd saved myself. 
>
> I was very wrong.
>
> When I finally saw the GIC, what I got wasn't that help, but persistent stonewalling, through a facade of concern. They interrogated me about my school life, my family, my sexuality, my mental health, the sexual assault I'd suffered as a kid, and they used all of it against me.
>
> Everything they could find to justify making me wait a little longer - it was always 'the next appointment' when they'd discuss puberty blockers or hormones. And remember this was with 5-8 months between appointments, so each delay was costly, esp with puberty on the horizon.
>
> But they always told me that I simply wasn't ready. Not even due to their call - they insisted that it was me. That what I was telling them suggested I wasn't really trans, that I wasn't sure, that I needed to give it more time before they could decide anything.
>
> One time I remember very clearly was as I was approaching my 17th birthday. They told me that people who go to university experience a great deal of life changes and that I needed to wait until university before making any kind of call. Uni was still over a year away then.
>
> All the while, I was encouraged to try other approaches than transition. Perhaps I should just spend more time with 'other boys'. I could try getting a girlfriend, having sex. Or maybe I was just gay. I should simply try not being trans. After all 'that's what I was telling them'
>
> I was 16. I trusted them because I had to trust them, they were my doctors, I had nowhere else to turn, especially with no support from my Catholic school, my parents, or any local trans people. I was dependent on them and they let me down badly and abused that trust.
>
> In hindsight, it was very clear they were never going to actually treat me in any sense. It was all a stalling exercise and their excuses were made up - using anything they could get - just to keep me in that endless holding pattern. Even when I cried begging them to help.
>
> Except the holding pattern was designed to be indefinite. Even when I did go to university, as in the example above, they still spun new reasons at me. At age 19, I was no closer to any treatment at all than I was at age 14. And I'd hit puberty by then.
>
> Unless you're trans yourself, you probably can't fully appreciate what going through the wrong puberty is like - especially with full awareness of its wrongness, that it was fully preventable, and that those who could do that were simply not (and were saying it was your fault)
>
> It's pure pure body horror. Everything goes the wrong way, in ways that make you feel sick, that just don't feel like *you*, in ways that are permanent or at least very costly to undo. It's like feeling yourself slip away with you powerless to do anything about it. It's HELL.
>
> Your own body betrays you. It no longer feels yours. Even your voice is stolen from you. And it feels wrong on such a basic primal level you can't even articulate to anyone who doesn't know that world-shattering pain. And you're still a child then.
>
> For me at that age, after having been told by other (much older) trans people on the net that I was so lucky to be doing things so young - it felt like game over. That that was it, I'd never be able to be myself anymore, that I'd lost my sole chance at a happy life.
>
> When I reached my second year of university, much of puberty over, and I was *still* being told the same things - that I didn't seem actually trans, that I needed to give it more time, that I should enjoy being a man more, that perhaps I just needed a girlfriend - I broke.
>
> I gave up. Stopped attending any more appointments because it was clear it wasn't going to achieve anything, and I felt like there was nothing to achieve anymore anyway, as I said, it felt like game over. I just wanted to die. Wanted any excuse to die. There was no point.
>
> The only reason I didn't die is that I was too concerned with upsetting those around me, so I carried on with uni, but I was a shell. I didn't look after myself in any way, I stopped being as outgoing and active, my lively online presence dwindled away to nothing. I was empty.
>
> That thing where you wish something would kill you so you could have oblivion without the guilt it would cause those around you if you took your own life. I deliberately don't look crossing the road. I never expected to live long. What was the point? I was gone. I was denied.
>
> You can still see it in my old livejournal posts - going from a bubbly and poetic girl flirting, discussing anime, writing stories, being emotional and naive in all those teenage ways - to just doing my uni assignments, disappearing into video games, no longer writing anything.
>
> I was fortunate to have a year abroad as part of my degree, and living by myself in a German forest with new friends, I slowly began to start to rebuild myself as much as I could, using the money I made teaching out there to fund private hormones and transition upon return to UK
>
> And that's how I eventually got to where I am today. But it'd be a lie to say everything just fixed itself. I'd not be writing this otherwise. I still recall all the trauma of being forced through the wrong puberty, being constantly delayed, told it was what was best for me.
>
> I've since learned what was happening. I can't be entirely sure as I don't have any notes from that time, any records. I was a teen after all, and it was still the early 2000s before things were all done electronically.
>
> Further, my parents were absolutely not supportive, they  told me it was God's will that I was born a boy and that I shouldn't change that, I had to go behind their backs the whole time, and the few times they found any GIC letters they threw them away. I have no records.
>
> And I feel like I can't trust my own memories because that's what gaslighting does. I have my old private diary entries, which are deeply painful to read, but I just remember being made to feel like I was saying the wrong things, that I wasn't trying enough options, etc.
>
> But what I recall very much matches the methodology of a Canadian psych called Kenneth Zucker and his 'desistence therapy', a technique designed to make trans children 'desist' from being trans, through the idea that they'll grow out of it - that you can make them grow out of it.
>
> Rather than the standard NHS practice of waiting until trans kids turned 18 before beginning treatment - something the Tavistock was doing at the time, and which a similar aged friend of mine who saw the Tavistock at the same time ended up doing - they tried to desist me.
>
> I don't know why. I assume they didn't know what to do with a trans child when their other patients were adults so followed Zucker's methodology, which was medically uncontroversial at the time.
>
> All the smiley, 'supportive' meetings I'd had with psychs at the GIC were attempts to get me to stop with this whole trans thing. That they could convince me that I didn't really want that, through trying to get me to be a boy, through saying it was the fault of my assault, etc.
>
> (do you have any idea how much it hurts to be told that something traumatic you had done to you, like the assault I had when I was 11, is the reason why you're having further trauma inflicted on you? Like it was my own fault and I was paying the price)
>
> Told it was a sexual thing that I could solve through fucking somebody. That it was a mental health thing and I just needed to be happier. That it was an idle fancy I'd drop in the real world of uni. And that this was what I really wanted. Of course that I wasn't genuinely trans"
>
> I struggle to say all this because - while I know I am trans and have for a long time - I still feel like it was actually my fault that I never got treatment then. That I'd said the wrong things, presented the wrong way, that I should have made more an effort, that I should etc.
>
> Rationally, I know there was nothing I could have done, that what I said or did was irrelevant, because that's how desistence therapy works, the whole idea is to get the child to stop being trans after all. But still, it's hard not to blame myself. I do, in my darker moments.
>
> Part of what made me realise this was desistence therapy was speaking to a friend (who I won't name publicly here, she can come forward if she wants) who went through the same thing at Zucker's clinic in Toronto. Our experiences tallied almost exactly despite the different places
>
> Zucker's medically discredited now, though the anti-trans campaigners still love him (even though he's also extremely creepy towards the kids who see him). However when he was struck off, the very psychs I'd seen at the UK gender clinic signed a letter defending him. A red flag.
>
> Desistence therapy assumes that you can stop trans children from being trans by forcing them to grow out of it - one way or another. In practice, this means leaving them broken, depressed, and suicidal, believing that they did this to themselves. It's immensely cruel.
>
> 'Desisting' is of course a term used to describe criminal acts and that very much reflects how it views transness in young people as something going very wrong with them and that they can get away from it and live a 'clean life' if only they're held back like it's a life of crime
>
> I used the term 'conversion therapy' at the beginning of this thread because that's what it is. Doing trans healthcare is never the goal, the entire aim is to stop a trans kid being trans, you just do it by keeping them waiting endlessly rather than directly forcing them.
>
> These are children and you're gaslighting them that not only are they not what they say they are, but that they know they're not and that this is the outcome they themselves desired. This is immensely abusive and deeply shattering to the psyche. Trust me, I know.
>
> I have had a lot of traumas in my past - many which I've never gone into publicly and which I have no intention of doing so - my life, especially my early life, is a mess - but this is one I've struggled to talk about the most because it's still so upsetting. I live with it.
>
> The fact that I am who I am today wouldn't have been possible without a lot of self-reflection (obviously going through male puberty wasn't actually 'game over' for me) and therapy but I still have the signs of PTSD from the whole experience across the latter half of my teens.
>
> In some ways I feel I have survivors' guilt. That I made it through this, so the responsibility in dealing with it rests solely on my shoulders. Heck, this is why I'm making this extremely long thread today. But I don't know of anyone else who went through this in the UK.
>
> Whether anyone else did, I don't know. As I said, I was meant to be referred to the Tavistock. The GIC I ended up at clearly didn't know what to do with me and looked to Zucker's (deeply abusive) methodology. But there might have been others who were likewise broken. Or killed.
>
> It was *very hard* to be actively trans as a young teen c.2002. Thanks to Section 28 there were very few resources, so you had to be good at research to even know it was a thing beyond the sensationalist occasional lurid glossy mag stories. So maybe it was just me. I don't know.
>
> Part of why I decided to keep living and try life after all was a desire to ensure this never happened again to anyone in the UK. But I was never in a position to help ensure that. I wasn't able to raise the alarm as a teen - Mermaids wouldn't help me then - I was powerless.
>
> While trans youth healthcare in the UK since then has still been pretty awful and not remotely sufficient, I've at least not heard of active desistence therapy techniques being used (though I know horrifyingly trans kids are still effectively forced through wrong puberties).
>
> However recently with the upswing in anti-trans activism and the increasing moral panic about trans kids, I've seen the ideas of desistence therapy coming back into the public eye. It's what the anti-trans orgs campaign for, I've read their documentation.
>
> And whenever I see anyone advocating for 'desistence', I cannot think straight, because what happened to me comes flooding back, and all I can think is that it must not happen to any other child. I don't want anyone to ever have to suffer like that ever again. You can't imagine.
>
> Those who don't believe trans is *really* a thing, or that it's some kind of adulthood perversion, or a social contagion akin to the dancing plague, they all believe that trans kids cannot be, and that you can somehow stop them if you just hold them back, tell them you're helping
>
> that desistence therapy is a 'kindness' because it 'allows' the child to stop being trans through making them think it's their own idea, that you can keep them away from it long enough it will stop, that it's not as brutal as straight-up conversion therapy.
>
> THIS. IS. BULLSHIT. Take it from me who actually lived it, not from some columnist who thinks transness was invited in 2010, or some parent who thinks they can un-trans their child, or some anti-trans activist who spins webs of concern trolling, or Kenneth fucking Zucker.
>
> Desistence isn't "letting kids stop being trans", it's *forcing* them to not be, it's *disallowing* transness, it's even right there in the word itself. It doesn't work through changing the child's mind, it works through making the child eventually give up. Conversion therapy.
>
> It's imperative that desistence therapy be seen and regarded as a variant of conversion therapy. Don't let its gaslighting nature or the fact it never *directly* pushes conversion fool you. It is abusive, it is damaging, it is inhumane, and it leaves children with lifelong damage
>
> Desistence therapy is sold as a kinda humane 'cure' for transness. Not beating transness out of the kid but encouraging them to drop it, to 'move on', to 'learn to be a boy/girl instead'. This is all equivocation, it makes no difference in terms of harm done to the child. I know.
>
> And on top of that, you leave the child blaming themselves, for the rest of their lives. Any parent who truly cares for their kid should rightfully view that as abhorrent, but current discourse is selling it as a panacea instead. I'm deeply deeply afraid for current trans kids.
>
> Again, I'm the only one I'm aware of who underwent this particular kind of treatment as a child in the UK (I know plenty who had the just as harmful more traditional kind of conversion therapy, unfortunately). There may well be more.
>
> But it means I know what it does, first-hand.
>
> I don't want to spill my traumas quite so openly on this platform - I'm making myself very vulnerable here, opening myself up like this - but as I said, I feel a kind of responsibility to explain what happened to me, to leave a record, and to plead that it never be allowed again
>
> I've long wondered what, if any, purpose my trauma had. There's no karmic reward for the suffering I went through. What doesn't kill you just leaves you wounded. But if I can somehow stop what happened to me happening to even one other person, I'd give my all to do that.
>
> Hence this thread. Sorry it's been so raw. I could have made it longer but I worried about its length as it is. I just felt I needed to get it out there, especially with recent developments. I needed people to know what happened, what desistence therapy is, what it does.
>
> I'd really appreciate it if you could spread the word, let people know, pass on my testimony, promote this thread, have this all mean something in at least some way. In some ways it feels like one of the most important things I've ever written. That people know what this is.
>
> It's such a fucked-up thing to do a kid and I recall it every time I look in a mirror even now in my mid-30s. I'm both my current self, angry about what this does, what it did to me, and my teen self, scared, doubting every aspect of herself, feeling like her life was stolen.
>
> Please help me stop this ever happening again.
>
> This was deeply scary to write and share and I've been putting it off for a long time, but I felt that I had to say something, at long last.
>
> Thank you so much for reading.
>
> Elaine Scattermoon
>
> PS: It seems desistence therapy is now being called 'gender exploratory therapy', but it's still the exact same thing under a different name. Don't let the phrasing fool you, it's not about exploration but rather trying to push acceptance of birth gender.
>
> You might also see desistence therapy called 'watchful waiting' esp in UK, though they won't tell the young patients themselves that. These euphemisms all imply a lack of harm but that's deliberately misleading: remember we're often *begging* for *urgent* help at these points.
>
> 'Doing nothing' is *not* the neutral option because it's actually 'forcing kids through wrong puberty' which is deeply traumatic body horror. Blockers on the other hand are neutral: they hold off that puberty and give the option of continuing with it later if so desired.
>
> PS2: I went over my own diary entries from the time again and recalled that the clinicians kept trying to tell me how very masculine I was, how masculine my voice sounded, how manly I looked. None of that was true - I was actually bullied a lot for being so girly as a kid/teen.
>
> "You're such a manly boy, look how handsome you are, hear how deep your voice is, you could easily get a girlfriend, you'll feel so much better, you've basically told us yourself"
>
> meanwhile I'm getting thrown into the mud at school (& worse) on a regular for being a girly gay.

Thank you for writing and sharing Elaine. I'm glad you're alive, and I'm glad I got to hear your perspective. ~AS

## Unions

### Starbucks

Just a couple days ago, on November 1st 2022, Starbucks Workers United ([@SBWorkersUnited](https://twitter.com/SBWorkersUnited)) posted updates [here](https://twitter.com/SBWorkersUnited/status/1587530037443678210?t=8uPVCxI-kUTL7tvmn7kfqQ&s=19):

> UNION WINS THREAD ALERT: Less than a year ago, there were ZERO unionized Starbucks stores in the US. Today, there are 258! Let’s take a look at some of the incredible things workers have fought for and WON over the past year…

> One of our first public demands was fighting for seniority pay for baristas. How did Starbucks respond? By implementing the first seniority pay in the company’s 50 year history.
>
> Union workers raised the issue of inadequate and failing equipment. What were we able to pressure the company into doing? Store renovations ACROSS the country, including new ovens.
>
> After working through a global pandemic, our campaign demanded that workers get paid a living wage. Starbucks acquiesced to our demands and implemented a $15 minimum wage across the country.
>
> Stores that have been closed, that have unionized, are able to bargain with the company to ensure that partners are transferred to a preferred location and are able to keep their guaranteed hours.
>
> One of the first proposals that unionized Starbucks workers in Elmwood brought to the company was a policy on a more tolerant dress code. Soon after this proposal was presented, Starbucks implemented our ideas at stores nation-wide.
>
> Another one of our proposals that Starbucks has implemented across the country is faster sick time accrual, which is something that unionized workers have been advocating for since the very beginning of our campaign.
>
> Our campaign is responsible for the removal of Kevin Johnson as CEO of Starbucks and ushering in almost an entirely new C-Suite of Starbucks executives. Union-busters like Rossann Williams & John Culver have both left (or are leaving) the company.

> Not only did our campaign pressure Starbucks to implement long overdue changes, but we continue to make the company concede to our demands by striking and other actions.

> For example, the campaign’s action have resulted in bad managers being removed from stores, the purchasing of new equipment, and acceptance of workers’ availability.

> Despite Starbucks trying to do everything to stop us from organizing, partners continue to stand up, fight back, and organize. If this is all that we won less than a year into our campaign, just imagine the possibilities of what is to come.

Great work to the workers of Starbucks! Here's the Starbucks Workers United [bit.ly](https://bit.ly/m/sbworkersunited) with links to their site and resources.

### Starbucks: externalities

Though we can see workers gaining power at these Starbucks, that didn't come easy. As we see from an ex-Starbucks employee in Ithaca, NY ([@valleyboyboy](https://twitter.com/valleyboyboy)):

> My life is terrible since Starbucks fired me. I can't get a job despite filling out every app I can. I have no money. My internet is out bc non payment. It has caused irreparable damage to my mental health. All because I started a union.
>
> This company is evil. I have no backup plan. No family to help. I have lived off gofundme money until understandably people couldn't give anymore.
>
> I have nobody. No friends. Every day is bad. I can't even watch movies. My one refuge. I have to cancel all my services now.
>
> I am losing my stability. I will have no home. All because I took a chance to make my workplace better for myself and my coworkers.
>
> Starbucks doesn't care. None of the management that pretended to be my family for years reached out in any way.
>
> Now I'm rotting in poverty.
>
> Fuck you @Starbucks

I'm sorry to hear these stories (and worse) constantly as I see workers try to fight for their rights across the US and the world. The callous treatment demonstrates, _clearly_, the necessity of unions and stronger worker protections. It should not be possible for corporations to inflict poverty upon workers who are struggling to survive!

### re: twitter

As Anne V Clark ([@annevclark](https://twitter.com/annevclark)) says [here](https://twitter.com/annevclark/status/1587815235469066241?t=iI1B3ulwTNVOLhZAWBujMw&s=19):

> The reason unions are badass is if a billionaire walks into your office and starts demanding you work 12 hours a day 7 days a week to prove to him you deserve your job, you and your coworkers can legally make that one of the worst days of his life.
>
> Make Elon write all the code! From what I understand he's some kind of genius who never sleeps! Should be easy for him!
>
> > Employer: we don't think we need you!
> >
> > Employees: okay (goes home)
> >
> > Employer: no wait
>
> COUGH COUGH [https://code-cwa.org](https://code-cwa.org)

Thanks Anne, for the good points, and sorry to all the workers who have been crawling through the mud at twitter to keep the site running through what I understand to have been a hellish year. Your work is appreciated, as are you. Maybe not from above, but from some guy writing his little website. Thanks, really.

## Bail and Criminalization

### Bail

From Arielle Ivy ([@ArielleIvy_](https://twitter.com/ArielleIvy_)) on her thread [here](https://twitter.com/ArielleIvy_/status/1584677755484094467?t=9w45M6pLSoumbWJOHl-TQQ&s=19):

> Today I watched a judge get upset b/c an attorney said during a bail application that the family had not been able to save enough money to buy their loved one’s freedom. She didn’t like that characterization of bail. Which leads me to ask, what do judges think bail is?
>
> Bail is LITERALLY a sum required to be paid for a person’s freedom. Is the bench so high folks lose touch with reality once they ascend to it?

Let's all you and me remember what bail is as well; it can be easy to forget, if you don't often interact with it personally.

### Criminalization Culture

From Roderic Day ([@RodericDay](https://twitter.com/RodericDay)) on his thread [here](https://twitter.com/RodericDay/status/1584373120924004355?t=GrErlCpYhKu9bPMdOfdbag&s=19):

> Disagreements about habits are so suffused in terror of criminalization that Westies can't have chill discussions about them without panicking.
> 
> > "Watching this movie is bad for
your self-esteem."
> >
> > "YOU WANT TO BAN ART!?"
>
> > "Weed makes you sluggish."
> >
> > "YOU WANT TO JAIL ME!?"
>
> I consider being able to work out a disagreement with a good friend an *essential* life skill.
>
> And I mean reaching a satisfying resolution that settles the dispute, not deferring it forever with a lazy "agree to disagree" non-conclusion.
>
> It's the main driver of growth.
>
> Dealing with unjust authority is the most embittering thing in the world.
>
> But the salve that America offers its victims is just childish metaphysical egoism.
>
> "Be yourself!" it insists, flattering you into ignoring whether your habits contribute to your predicament.

### Old lady on the NY Metro - Oct 25, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/FelipeDLH/status/1584887584307961862))

From Felipe De La Hoz ([@FelipeDLH](https://twitter.com/FelipeDLH)) who covers immigration news on substack at [Border/Lines](https://borderlines.substack.com/):

> On a train where a small older woman was muttering incoherently to herself. To be crystal clear, she was standing still, not harassing or even addressing anyone in particular. Doors open, two cops board and remove her, apparently at the direction of the conductor
>
> They don’t give her a reason or anything, just “black jacket? Come with us ma’am, you can take the next train, come on,” which seems like an obvious lie. A few people mutter about it, the doors close, train leaves
>
> No one was being hurt, but I guess just having some issues quietly to yourself is now grounds for removal. It’s clear that the flooding of cops into the subways has little to do with public safety, and much to do with public perception of disorder

## Homelessness

### Shelters

From Piper ([@yourfriendpiper](https://twitter.com/yourfriendpiper)) on her thread [here](https://twitter.com/yourfriendpiper/status/1588239681954582529?t=sTWYBKEwmbpBUJOuBemh4g&s=19):

> Once again repeating: if large numbers of people would prefer to sleep outside in 40 degrees and raining over the shelter offered, the problem is with what you’re offering.
>
> (Not an actual policy suggestion) Everyone who supports “shelter enforcement” should be forced at the hands of armed state agents to live in a shelter for a week.

### How to get off the streets

Comrade Red, [@IronProle](https://twitter.com/IronProle), gave this response to the question "If you woke up homeless, hungry, with $20 to your name, and had none of the connections you have now, how would you get off the streets?"

> Id buy some dope and trade it up til i could get a hotel room.  Might take me like three or four days, but id find some under the table work and slide into a low credit "apartment" in a few weeks.  Id have a real apartment in a few months, with like 22 roommates.
>
> Ive done it a couple times.  Long hours sitting in the QFC common space, buying something occasionally so i don't get booted.
>
> But the reality for most people is that they dont.  And the longer they stay homeless, statistically.
>
> Statistically the longer one stays homeless the more likely you are to remain that way.  The loss of a mailing address is often and insurmountable barrier among other pitfalls you cannot possibly predict.
>
> The fact is that in King County, HALF of houseless people work one or more jobs despite their lack of housing.
>
> This fact is why many houseless people are "service resistant" because all too often sleeping in a shelter conflicts with work.
>
> Strict entry times for shelters make sense logistically but human wise, its an awful policy that drives people working hard to better their conditions choose to sleep in a ditch.
>
> Not to mention the safety, security and hygiene concerns of non profit shelters and their temporary, underpaid staff who are given nothing abd expected to work miracles.  It leads to unsafe and unsanitary conditions that people are correct in rejecting.
>
> The hyper policing and vigilante "justice" from housed people increases the chances of becoming caught up in the legal system.  They get you once and then they keep coming for you.  You never really leave the carceral system.
>
> So now you have no address, you are working under the table.  You have a police record that follows you everywhere.
>
> The barriers continue to mount and you learn to cope.  Housed life becomes a far off memory.
>
> At least youve still got some income until you fall off the roof of a house at work.  No workers comp for you.
>
> You go to the emergency room and they treat you like an animal and discharge you with aspirin.
>
> You cant sleep.  Your old boss doesnt answer your calls or texts.  There is no work and it hurts to breath anyhow.  You couldnt do labor if you wanted to.
>
> Your cash drains away and youve lost the last the last of the belongings you had from home.  Your clothes are all moldy or destroyed.
>
> You ate hungry but the nearest store is 3 miles away uphill.
>
> Someone else in the jungle offers you a pain pill.  You have no way of knowing what it is but the pain in unbearable.  This is a bittersweet moment of mercy.
>
> It works.  You can move or breath but the next 5 years is a blur of increasing pain and disability.  Youve overdosed on pressed pills, your fellow campers saving your life.
>
> Nobody recognizes you on the street.  Youve become a corporeal ghost.
>
> You have days of full on psychosis.  You get thrown out of stores.  The local non profits have written you off, since you have so little chance of improving their city stats to get funding.  You are gristle.
>
> You go in and out of county lockup for eating stolen food in the store.  The employees beat you up regularly but you have no recourse.
>
> One winter you die unceremoniously.
>
> There is a meager display setup where you perished but houses kids light it on fire in a few days.
>
> This could be anyone.
>
> Weve met houseless mathematicians, ex doctors, engineers and sooooo many blue collar folks.
>
> You are not in full control of your health or circumstances.
>
> Anyone can lose it all overnight for no reason, for no fault.

## More Red

More stuff from IronProle, which should get re-organized onto his page after I'm done saving all my twitter stuff.

### Cancer - Aug 23, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/IronProle/status/1562148357451030528?s=19))

> Wellllll folks
>
> I just got some extremely negative Cancer news.  Turns out you cant defeat cancer with self confidence.
>
> If you got a spare thought, save one for my Wife.
>
> It is what it is.  I have no control over any of this so im going to just live or die.  Im gonna kiss my wife and smoke my weed.
>
> My fate was never under my control.  Ive always been a War Man, and wars have casualties.  They have defeats.
>
> Whatever you do, dont feel sorry for me.  Ive seen my foes defeated in combat.  Ive been a professional bicyclist.  Ive been a husband and mentor and ive lifted up thousands with my work.
>
> Ive lived more lives than many get.
>
> Make art of me.  Celebrate, but never be sorry.
>
> I made peace with death a long time ago.  You have to when you take up your rifle.  Swords, you get it.
>
> I was hoping i would live to get a warriors death.  Maybe i still will.
>
> But either way, War Mans live and we die.

### Are you ready to die? - Oct 19, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/IronProle/status/1582826297419771904?t=g7FH7jYD1jsVwR0zjBorzQ&s=19))

> MH counselor asked me if im ready to die.  I answer yes without hesitation.
>
> I tell her that life is just a sparrow flying thru a warm house, in one window and out another.  We are dead far longer than we are alive, so you gotta be impactful while you are here.
>
> I told her that if you dont wait for life to fill you up but instead fill the world up with as much of you as you have to offer, death is no worry.  Ive left my greasy paw prints all over this society.
>
> Everything is as it should be!

### Garden Analogies - Sep 16, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/IronProle/status/1570969318770487296?t=T-ofqibgfJtzp1kU2al9yw&s=19))

> Garden analogies are so good for explaining revolutionary processes.
>
> A garden is not an event, and neither is a revolution.  Both are complex processes, one historical and the other biological.
>
> You cannot pull on your onions to make them grow faster.
>
> Nor can you ignore history and events.  We only build by navigating history.  We make our own fates, but mediated by conditions that are ever shifting.

### Tilling and Conditioning of the Soil - Sep 16, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/IronProle/status/1570911724685107202?t=gcRfDV3T2rPDxzjn1RyNuw&s=19))

> Mutual Aid is a necessary pre-condition but is not the revolution itself.  Nobody should be claiming otherwise.
>
> It is the tilling and conditioning of the soil in preparation for the seeds of revolution.  Its where we discover new ideas and build new systems.
>
> Logistics cannot simply be summoned from whole cloth.  Systems of acquisition and distribution, moving people and things, require strong organization and clear communications.
>
> Mutual Aid is where we put our hands on the materiel limitations of our communities.  Where we build up our allies and comrades.
>
> There is no decent excuse for looking down on mutual aid.  If you cannot see its worth then that would be your own shortcoming.
>
> Depending on the good will of our communities is a delightful daydream.  We must build systems that are robust and efficient, putting labor and materials exactly on target.
>
> This is how we will survive long enough to win.  First we must live.

### Young queers - Aug 11, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/IronProle/status/1557802407676878848?t=1y_yy3b7FigL2gwTU5E8Ng&s=19))

> The young queers sometimes don't recognize the struggles that came before them.  We had to fight and bleed to make room for yall and we dont look and act like yall.  We came from tougher times where we had to become arnored and clawed up.
>
> The veterans of your struggle you now find yourselves in look ugly and mean and appear regressive sometimes.
>
> Like any veteran of a war, we need understanding and compassion.
>
> I learned to walk and talk hetero cuz thats what kept you safe when there was nobody coming to help you.
>
> You could have been the next Matthew Shephard.  So we armed up and got really fuckin hard to kill.
>
> "You some kinda queer?" By anyone makes my hair stand up on end.
>
> My Dad taught me that if more than two men ask you "you some kinda queer?" Its time for violence.
>
> If one hetero asks you that, they want to fuck but you should run away.
>
> All this to say that there wasnt celebrations of queer life.  There were no supports.  Not outside the big cities!  
>
> We supported us, but we had to give up huge parts of what many consider queer culture.  We survived.
>
> My Dad has been a closet queer his whole life but the fuckin Queer comes out real fast when you starting with some Homophobia.  He would put you on your ass.
>
> Im less closeted but you best believe the Queer comes out when its time for war.  War Queers!

> Too much left unfinished, but the kids are young and motivated.  History will march on and victory will be ours, the working class will take all we've built.

Thanks, as always, Red. Pic of him [here](https://twitter.com/IronProle/status/1562523534991454214?t=RveZJ5nfGdv2lnn_KSLeHQ&s=19) and somewhere on my hard drive, I'll throw it up on the page when I do my image refactor.

## On Debs

This'll be a page at some point, with more info about Debs and that era of history. But for now, just some quotes off twitter.

> The capitalists are combined against you. They are reducing wages. They have control of the courts. They are doing everything they can to destroy your power. You have got to follow their example. You have got to unify your forces.

> Your grandfather made a pair of shoes, and they were his own. You make a thousand pairs of shoes where he made one. You do not own a single one of them. You can produce wealth in fabulous abundance, but you have not got it. Why not?

## On Mao

These'll be added to that existing page in some form, later.

> What is work? Work is struggle. There are difficulties and problems in those places for us to overcome and solve. We go there to work and struggle to overcome these difficulties. A good comrade is one who is more eager to go where the difficulties are greater.

src: ["On the Chungking Negotiations" (October 17, 1945), Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 58.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/red-book/ch21.htm)

> Communists should set an example in being practical as well as far-sighted. For only by being practical can they fulfil the appointed tasks, and only far-sightedness can prevent them from losing their bearings in the march forward.

src: ["The Role of the Communist Party of China in the National War" (October 1938), Selected Works, Vol. II, p. 198.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/red-book/ch28.htm)

> Conscientious practice of self-criticism is still another hallmark distinguishing our Party from all other political parties. As we say, dust will accumulate if a room is not cleaned regularly, our faces will get dirty if they are not washed regularly. Our comrades' minds and our Party's work may also collect dust, and also need sweeping and washing. The proverb "Running water is never stale and a door-hinge is never worm-eaten" means that constant motion prevents the inroads of germs and other organisms. To check up regularly on our work and in the process develop a democratic style of work, to fear neither criticism nor self-criticism, and to apply such good popular Chinese maxims as "Say all you know and say it without reserve", "Blame not the speaker but be warned by his words" and "Correct mistakes if you have committed them and guard against them if you have not" - this is the only effective way to prevent all kinds of political dust and germs from contaminating the minds of our comrades and the body of our Party.

## US History

### United States backed coups in Latin America

Another from Armani ([@historyoarmani2](https://twitter.com/historyoarmani2)) [here](https://twitter.com/historyoarmani2/status/1370837690585866244):

> Guatemala 1954: the USA overthrew Jacobo Arbenz Guzman because he had a land reform program that took over large estates. The CIA believed Guzman was a Communist because he gave more than 200,000 acres of American-owned land to poor people.
>
> Brazil 1964: USA backed military coup overthrew João Goulart because he had ties with communist countries & urged congress to approve land redistribution. The day before he was ousted he proposed a package to congress which would benefit the working class people of Brazil.
>
> Dominican Republic 1965: after getting rid of the dictator Trujillo, Dominicans had their first free election & elected Juan Bosch. His pro castro sentiments, creation of the Dominican Revolutionary Party, & ability to unite all factions of Dominican society threatened the USA.
>
> Chile 1973: the first Marxist president to ever be democratically elected, Salvador Allende was overthrown by the United States and murdered during the coup because he nationalized healthcare, large industries, gave free education and food for children, and redistributed land.
>
> Nicaragua 1980s: Not a coup, but one of the worst cases of US involvement in Latin America by the hands of the cia, which funded Contra death squads against the Popular People’s Movement. 50,000+ people were murdered by the US backed Contras
>
> El Salvador 1980s: Not a coup but US funds death squads to destroy the Popular People’s Movement, killing 75,000+ people.
>
> Grenada 1980s: The USA invaded Grenada after a People’s Revolution took control of the country and started implementing communist policies. The United States wanted to prevent “communism from spreading to other Carrie an countries”
>
> Venezuela 2002: The failed coup backed by the US was an attempt to get Hugo Chavez out of office because he was a self declared socialist who was and had strong ties with Cuba and Fidel Castro.

## Prole Academy

[Prole Academy](https://www.proleacademy.com/) is a "radical book blog for working people in a hurry" - they outline Marxist theory in order to give workers quick overviews of books and concepts, to help them start their education.

Although I found them on twitter, I won't link their threads since they're image heavy - the same content can be found on their website.

Their site has [briefings](https://www.proleacademy.com/reviews/series/briefings/)  - in-depth looks at a concept, event, or person that matters, designed to be read with as much or as little time as you have. You can find their first briefing series at [Marxism 101](https://www.proleacademy.com/reviews/series/marxism-101/).

They also have [book reviews](https://www.proleacademy.com/latest-posts/review/) on leftist works. From classics like [State and Rev](https://www.proleacademy.com/review/the-state-and-revolution-vladimir-lenin/) to modern works like David Graeber's [Bullshit Jobs](https://www.proleacademy.com/review/bullshit-jobs-david-graeber/), they provide quick one-pagers and highlights to get caught up in brief. Although I always recommend referencing the originals (as you should with anything you read on my site), summaries and articles can be a great place to start. So, thanks to Benjamin Walker and the folks at Prole Academy for trying to make theory more accessible to the masses!

They also have a [bookshelf](https://www.proleacademy.com/bookshelf/), [courses](https://www.proleacademy.com/course-listing/), a [blog](https://www.proleacademy.com/blog/), some [about info](https://www.proleacademy.com/about-us/), and a [buymeacoffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ProleAcademy) if you want to support their efforts.

## Nia Frome

Buncha her tweets. I'll probably make a separate page, or maybe tack it onto the [RedSails one](/posts/on-redsails).

### Marketing Socialism - Jan 31, 2019 ([src](https://twitter.com/NiaFrome/status/1091004191022202880))

This eventually became an article on RedSails, [Marketing Socialism](https://redsails.org/marketing-socialism/), but I saw it on twitter first.

> when i was a kid i also believed 'communists should ditch that label, for PR reasons'. now i think you make more headway owning it than dishonestly disavowing it. not least because *someone will almost always bring up stalin no matter what you call yourself*
>
> stalin is a powerful trope for normies. his name stands for the perverse emergence of injustice from the overzealous pursuit of justice. it's dramatic irony. it's a morality tale about how power corrupts.
>
> that mythic trope stands as a barricade between normies and socialism *no matter what kind of spin you put on socialism*
>
> what are the crimes normally attributed to stalin? the show trials, the purges, the gulag, forced collectivization... in other words state violence. the socialisms that define themselves in opposition to stalin therefore downplay state violence as much as they can.
>
> but statehood IS (a monopoly on legitimate) violence. the question of who's doing violence to whom, and to what end, is the fundamental problem of politics. it's capitalism's answer to this question that makes us hate it so much.
>
> "nobody does violence to anybody" sounds good, but it's not actually a political position. political positions require charting out a plausible path from where we are now into the glorious future ahead, and that path goes through socialist states.
>
> the demonization of stalin is the demonization of socialist statehood itself. you will not convince a normie that the latter is false as long as they remain convinced that the former is true.
>
> the ritual denunciation of stalin on "the left" 1) presents a utopia of socialism without antagonism 2) flatters first-worlders and academics 3) spares people the unpleasantness of interrogating how their ideas about the past were formed 4) makes a virtue of losing and waiting
>
> if we decline to draw from the entire history of socialism-in-power in favor of utopian socialism or pragmatic liberalism, the range of results we can obtain will be limited to those achieved by utopian socialism (evanescent communes) and pragmatic liberalism (hellworld)
>
> pretending our new thing is sui generis and doesn't have anything to do with bad stalinism *doesn't actually mean we'll face different problems or have better solutions*. stalin faced problems that were generic to socialism. socialism isn't just a label, it's a class project.
>
> you don't actually transcend that project just by calling yourself something else, just like you don't transcend capitalism by calling yourself a post-capitalist.

### Why is Materialism Proletarian? - Jul 15, 2021 ([src](https://twitter.com/NiaFrome/status/1415685579430371328))

> why is materialism proletarian? because the objective world exerts a greater unifying force on the thinking of the proletariat than it does on the thinking of any other class. the bourgeoisie, a minority, can more easily wrap itself in myths and delusions of grandeur
>
> i think that, in an important sense, proletarian standpoint epistemology = materialism
>
> so wherever marxism becomes massive it becomes more materialist, more marxist
>
> the material world is what we share, ineluctably. the urgency with which it presses itself upon our thoughts is inversely proportional to our insulation against it, insulation in the form of money/power/privilege
>
> liberalism is a marvelous technology for sparing the bourgeoisie the unpleasantness of having to synthesize or hash out their various conflicting worldviews, it's a license for boundless subjectivism
>
> *because* each bourgeois can be counted on to step forward when it counts, that is, to defend their class interest in maintaining exploitation, keeping their insulation nice and thick, there is no need to reach any higher agreement on an objective basis
>
> the proletariat, which needs cooperation to survive, which is brutally exposed to the exigencies of life on this planet, can't afford to leave conflicts unresolved, it *needs* objectivity
>
> the proletariat as a class has more sense organs and greater sensitivity to the material world than any other class in history

### Problems - Aug 2, 2021 ([src](https://twitter.com/NiaFrome/status/1422056559132258308))

> capitalism creates problems that only socialism can solve. socialism is inevitable only in the sense that a logical conclusion is inescapable, not in the historic sense—it is of course possible that humans won't solve their problems

### Pessimism and Nostalgia - Oct 23, 2021

> it's bizarre to see tankies accused of both pessimism and nostalgia when like... we're the ones who think socialism is winning
>
> eschatological optimism is no optimism at all
>
> and if you've had the misfortune of speaking to an anti-stalinist leftist for more than two seconds you know they're giant fucking nerds about what could have been, that's their bread and butter
>
> similarly w/r/t the idea that we're only in it for the affective payoff of taboo-breaking, as if there were no affects associated with the anti-stalinist left (getting off at being smarter and more decent than everyone in history, potentially leading the "true" revolution, etc.)
>
> evidently some important taboos need breaking, also
>
> in general the psychologizing argument that paints your enemy as unwell, moved by pathological motives, can basically be turned against anyone, and is therefore abstract, empty. what matters is the *content* of the hope, the *content* of the nostalgia, *which* taboos get broken

### iPhones - Nov 8, 2021 ([src](https://twitter.com/NiaFrome/status/1457783112444698624))

> re: the "you're a communist with an iphone" thing 
>
> communists are the ones who believe that the incredible wealth of our society, though the product of heinous exploitation, should be made to serve the great masses, that capitalism has made unprecedented things possible
>
> the WHOLE POINT is to detourn, hijack, repurpose, salvage, adapt these things that are the product of class society in order to bring about a classless one. you don't DO that by keeping your hands off all the dirty products of class society (i.e. basically everything)
>
> furthermore:
> > the most ethical consumption would be to buy clothes handmade by versace himself
>
> the contradiction between being a communist and having an iphone is the contradiction between use-value and value at the heart of the commodity itself
>
> the law of value or abstract labor is a kind of monstrous drive to accumulate coupled with a monstrous indifference to concrete particulars. use-value, by contrast, is *all about* concrete particulars - if you want people to flourish, you want them to enjoy use-values.
>
> the underlying problem is that we produce stuff in this anarchic, clumsy, uncoordinated way, that our labor is socialized only after the fact, and so the law of value runs roughshod over everybody's flourishing
>
> making a socialist society means reasserting the sovereignty of conscious deliberation (the kind of thing iphones are very good at enabling btw) over and against the unconscious rule of blind economic forces

### Replacements - Nov 27, 2021 ([src](https://twitter.com/NiaFrome/status/1464721319426236426))

> whatever replaces capitalism has to be better than capitalism *at* doing stuff, not just better in an abstract/moral sense
>
> protracted economic war

### Race - Dec 30, 2021 ([src](https://twitter.com/NiaFrome/status/1476604613717540870))

> it's a race between socialism and human extinction

### Anarchism or Socialism? - Jan 24, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/NiaFrome/status/1485680106844700672))

> there's definitely an asymmetry between MLs and anticommunist leftists: MLs can explain anticommunism as stemming from propaganda, ignorance, and social pressures, whereas anticommunists can only explain marxism-leninism by saying that a lot of people just choose evil
>
> this has to do with the fact that we have more experience being them than they do being us

### Moving to the left - Feb 9, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/NiaFrome/status/1491470985626894342))

> you move to the left as you gain an awareness of crimes that are much worse than theft and murder: big, abstract crimes of using many people wrongly, squeezing them dry, denying them access to the means by which they might flourish, frittering away their lives on stupid nonsense
>
> all the baby-brained rightists can do is dial up the made up death toll of communism because they haven't progressed beyond like stage 4 of moral development
>
> i wasn't sure about this tweet because like, if you think about it, both the preconventional stages 1-2 and the conventional stages 3-4 are really just punishment avoidance, minor variations on what is essentially stage 1 thinking

### Markets - Apr 13, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/NiaFrome/status/1514323213047799818))

> the claim "markets are incompatible with socialism/communism" conflates two questions:
>
> 1) are markets a feature of communism? (no) 
>
> 2) must markets disappear immediately in order for something to be recognizable as socialism? (no)
>
> once again, by erasing any distinction between lower and higher, socialism and communism, ultras can revoke the socialism card of any society that has ever existed and render the term completely speculative, imaginary, philosophical, ideal
>
> eschatological

### Consistency vs Completeness - Oct 22, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/NiaFrome/status/1583992142225022977))

> locality/consistency/non-contradiction
>
> realism/completeness/holism
>
> you gain the latter only by sacrificing the former, with which it's mutually exclusive
>
> realism ≈ holism because realism says there's only *one* objective world (that's what objectivity means, the oneness of it, there not being as many worlds as there are perspectives) and that means realism hinges on counting the whole world *as* one, i.e. holism
>
> locality ≈ non-contradiction because it has to do with a subjective narrowing of one's focus (*only* in the sense x, *only* meaning y) with the *goal* of attaining consistency, self-identity, for one's objects. the worst slur a dialectician knows is "partial, one-sided"
>
> sorry to break it to you but the interdependence of all things got in there before your little controlled experimental setup and it ALWAYS WILL

### Imagining - Oct 31, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/NiaFrome/status/1587230560476340225))

> the correct form is the imperative: stop imagining the end of the world, start imagining the end of capitalism

### Understanding - Nov 1, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/NiaFrome/status/1587508187229573121))

> understanding stuff in a more proletarian way = understanding it better
> 
> this is because our *existing* understanding is so deeply biased by accumulated historical privileging of aristocratic and bourgeois perspectives

### Nov 3, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/NiaFrome/status/1588220817317453825))

> re: idealism vs. materialism, philosophy, the ivory tower, anti-intellectualism, kant vs. dogmatism, credentialism, communization of the epistemic, etc.
>
> the basic question: "who has the right to truth?"
>
> one answer with obvious appeal: "everyone!" but that can't be right, because people disagree. unless somehow our notion of truth could encompass those disagreements? but then it would no longer point in any particular direction, it wouldn't resemble *objective* truth at all.
>
> there's going to have to be some kind of hierarchy, some axis by which we measure who's closer and who's farther away from the truth. perhaps multiple axes? that sounds nicely pluralist, but again it waters down our conception of truth to the point where it can't do what we want.
>
> so you're gonna have to bite the bullet and admit that truth is unevenly distributed. the obvious next question is: who's got it?
>
> oops, there's been some drift from the first tweet. "who has the right to [declare or discover] truth" has turned into "who's got truth?" before i was talking about inequalities in its production (permits), now i'm talking about inequalities in its possession (poverty/wealth)
>
> so we could side with those who aren't allowed to declare or discover truth, or we could side with those who are richer in truth
>
> the obvious dialectical temptation is to come up with some sort of reasoning to show that these are in fact the same people
>
> oh wait i've already done that:
> > understanding stuff in a more proletarian way = understanding it better

## Climate and Energy

### Climate Collapse - Oct 22, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/MarxistHeathen/status/1583924752921468929))

A thread made by HeathenCommunist ([@MarxistHeathen](https://twitter.com/MarxistHeathen)), a CPUSA member in Arizona:

> Climate collapse is not one issue among many or another social ill that we need to defeat capitalism before dealing with. Before anything and everything else: it’s deadline.
>
> Shifting our focus to it isn’t about making it the most important “issue”. It’s not an “issue”.
>
> It’s a material condition that MUST shape the *entirety* of our strategy like a frame. That doesn’t mean we talk about it more than anything else. It just means it’s always on our mind when strategizing, even if we don’t say it.
>
> What does revolution mean when it’s not just a matter of liberation but total survival?
>
> What do scientific socialism and experimentation mean when we no longer have the time to “try again”?
>
> What does it mean for internal contradictions among our enemy when *they* know this and *they* know that working with us to actually defeat the other camp be defeated by us would be their death sentence?
>
> What does it mean for revolutionary strategy when asking the question of “how can we accomplish this” is an obsolete question, replaced by “how can we accomplish this in time”?
>
> What does it mean when we can’t afford another setback? When we can’t afford another century of struggle?
>
> What does it mean when believing revolution won’t happen in our lifetime stops being the planting of trees whose shade we will never sit under & is now accepting that our grandchildren will have no shade to sit in?
>
> Historical socialist strategy was premised on laying the groundwork for future struggle when it could not find a way to achieve its aims.
>
> How do we cope with the fact that we *are* that future generation that groundwork was laid for? That, if we can’t find a way to achieve our aims, that our only option is to keep looking until we find it?

> Every day I handle more money than I will ever make. Every day.
>
> At the start of my employment, my boss showed me videos of people stealing, and we both had a chuckle about it. How silly they were! There was a camera overhead. and it's not to watch the shoppers. See, we can't actually stop shoplifters. They get away with it maybe nine out of ten times. But we, who are all watched and tallied and witnessed? We are always caught.
>
> At first it was hard to hold one hundred dollar bills. An amount I had never seen before. An amount that didn't exist in my household. It's normal now. Here is something that is not for me.
>
> 'What the hell, I'll take another,' says the man, pondering out 200 dollar watches. What the hell. Total comes to 580 and not even a flinch in his face. I have been working for 11 hours today and made only 110 dollars. It will go to my rent. Today I work for free, it feels. When I get my check, I will have 35 dollars left for food and saving.
>
> The six hundreds he hands me go into the cash register. For a moment, I imagine having money. Then I put it away, counting out his change.
>
> I know for a fact we sell out products for double what they are worth. That I could be making commission. That they could hand me those 580 dollars and change my life and not even mark the difference in their checkbooks. He's not the only sale they make today, but I am the reason they made it. He's not the only one spending 600 dollars, but if I hadn't spent two hours with him telling me about his life, he wouldn't have spent any. I go home. I don't own a watch.
>
> I have watched and rewatched a video on how to make salmon four ways. My shopping list is always the same. Pasta. Rice. Tuna. If I can afford butter it was a good week. I dream of the world I will never walk in, where I can throw the best fish fillet in the cart with a shrug. I hold hundreds in my hand and look up at the camera. I put them under the cash drawer.
>
> I go to work. I scrap together my savings. I eat my bowl of rice slowly. My manager takes a paid week off from work just for this birthday. He owns a yacht.
>
> I'm not worth the cost of a watch.
