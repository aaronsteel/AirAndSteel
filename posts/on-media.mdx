Media conveys ideas. You learn things from the things you read and watch and listen to. You change because of what you see on the internet and what you hear in the news.You will probably change whilst reading this very site! (if you're paying any attention, I know focus is difficult sometimes).

I like to consume good media. Media I find useful, that I can gain good knowledge or ideas from. Who doesn't? Everyone likes to connect with a hopeful story or interesting (yet relatable) history. People love a good story.

These are some of my favorites, in many mediums and of many genres. Starting, of course, with my favorite medium: words.
