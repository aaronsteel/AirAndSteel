Ok. This should probably be the first page, chronologically. For right now, that's the idea.

## Dates

I'm not using dates as hard and fast times when things are being written or published. That's not the most effective usage.

These are all dated about Sept-Nov 2022 for right now. The months are just organizational chapters, right now, and they're all placed within the correct era (relatively). The ideas on the site are labelled and organized in the most relevant way possible (and I'll continue iterating and organizing as more content gets added). I'll go through how I'm using these months now:

### September

This is sorta the pre-appendix.

This site organization page will fall here, my [resource access](/posts/on-access) guide and helpful tool-tips will probably fall here as well. Stuff that's useful background knowledge, but that you don't need to focus on too hard yet. Come back when it's useful. For now, start with October.

### October

That's actually right now! This is where we start. The big stuff. Probably the most important month. My goal in writing this site (ie. [On Organizing](/posts/on-organizing)), my [values] (/posts/on-values)), my thoughts on [uniting](/posts/on-uniting), and intro to my [philosophical influences](/posts/on-philosophy).

I think it'll also have some important overarching thoughts I have. Thoughts [on technology](/posts/on-technology), thoughts [on media](/posts/on-media), thoughts [on learning](/posts/on-learning). Thoughts [on food](/posts/on-food), [on hobbies](/posts/on-hobbies), [on charity and how to do good](/posts/on-charity-and-charitability), [on religion](/posts/on-astrology-and-religion).

This month paints the picture of who I am right now, what I'm aiming to do with my life. But there will be many, many 

### November

Right now, November is individual articles, mostly of lists. Some sorted geographically, some by time period, some by topic. These will get linked from my overarching thoughts in October, but you should be able to start at any topic or area of interest and figure things out. I'll try to backlink to relevant parts in October as well as possible, so that we can refresh the big picture. We never wanna miss the forest for the trees.

Some to start are my readings organized by geographic location. The hometown (good ol' [North America](/posts/on-north-america)), the [rest of America](/posts/on-latin-america), [Asia](/posts/on-asia), [Europe](/posts/on-europe), [Africa](/posts/on-africa), [The Middle East](/posts/on-the-middle-east).

I may separate some of the thoughts on media/technology from October. I'll leave big-picture thoughts and quotes in October, but compile the larger reading lists and resources in November. [On Media](/posts/on-media) -> Media List, [On Technology](/posts/on-technology) -> technology-specific reading list, etc. (TODO, as always)

### December

I don't have any December articles yet. But I think this will be the place for articles on individual works, deep dives on individual leaders. Breaking down from broader thoughts on an overall history to individual thoughts, perspectives, and learnings. Looking at things like how specific individuals lived their lives, how specific people have made progress in specific areas. We'll focus in from Cuba -> Che, from Russia -> Lenin, you get the idea. I'll still try to interlink

### January

We may see that after the original few preface months, I may use actual dates to start dating in a stricter chronological fashion. That may allow for better visibility and transparency, clearer output to the reader. But January's far away, so I have no idea what articles put in that bucket may contain. Hope you stick around till then.
