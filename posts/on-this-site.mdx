Ok. This should probably be the first page, chronologically. For right now, that's the idea.

## So, what's goin on here? What is this?

Well, this is my site. Potentially you're reading it in a pdf, in which case it would be my book. Best viewed online, though, if you can: [https://www.airandsteel.xyz/](https://www.airandsteel.xyz/).

For the pdf, you can go [here](https://github.com/aaronsteel/AirAndSteel/blob/main/airandsteel_static_site.pdf)


### Why?

This started as an attempt to organize my thoughts and my resources in a central hub. As I progress, it takes shape with influence from the writers I talk about. Other modern writers who are attempting the same sort of thing exist in the team at [RedSails](https://redsails.org/) ([@RedSailsOrg](https://twitter.com/RedSailsOrg), [@RodericDay](https://twitter.com/RodericDay), [@NiaFrome](https://twitter.com/NiaFrome)) and [Unity-Struggle-Unity](https://unity-struggle-unity.org/) ([@USUMLPress](https://twitter.com/USUMLPress), [@primarycatdad](https://twitter.com/primarycatdad)).

As I refine my purpose, my thoughts, and my writings (ie. this site/book), I'm taking good note from all the authors I speak on. The [contributor's guide](https://unity-struggle-unity.org/submissions/contributors-guide-the-red-clarion/) for the [Red Clarion](https://unity-struggle-unity.org/clarion/) has helped shape my focus, and I'm sure it'll continue to shape over time.

I am also trying to use this space as a compilation of the resources I know of. I'm going to compile resource guides for [access](/posts/on-access), for [NY resources](/posts/on-ny-resources), and for other resource lists as I find them.

## Site Layout (ie. Dating System)

I'm not using dates as hard and fast times when things are being written or published. That's not the most effective usage.

These are all dated about Sept-Nov 2022 for right now. The months are just organizational chapters, right now, and they're all placed within the correct era (relatively). The ideas on the site are labelled and organized in the most relevant way possible (and I'll continue iterating and organizing as more content gets added). I'll go through how I'm using these months now:

### September

This is sorta the pre-appendix.

This site organization page falls here, the table of contents and index fall here. My [resource access](/posts/on-access) guide and helpful tool-tips will probably fall here as well. It'll also hold all my other resource guides, as I compile helpful lists of resources. Stuff that's useful background knowledge, but that you don't need to focus on too hard yet. Come back when it's useful. To get right to the reading, start with October.

### October

That's actually right now! This is where we start. The big stuff. Probably the most important month. My goal in writing this site (ie. [On Organizing](/posts/on-organizing)), my [values] (/posts/on-values)), my thoughts on [uniting](/posts/on-uniting), and intro to my [philosophical influences](/posts/on-philosophy).

I think it'll also have some important overarching thoughts I have. Thoughts [on technology](/posts/on-technology), thoughts [on media](/posts/on-media), thoughts [on learning](/posts/on-learning). Thoughts [on food](/posts/on-food), [on hobbies](/posts/on-hobbies), [on charity and how to do good](/posts/on-charity-and-charitability), [on religion](/posts/on-astrology-and-religion).

This month paints the picture of who I am right now, what I'm aiming to do with my life. But there will be many, many 

### November

Right now, November is individual articles, mostly of lists. Some sorted geographically, some by time period, some by topic. These will get linked from my overarching thoughts in October, but you should be able to start at any topic or area of interest and figure things out. I'll try to backlink to relevant parts in October as well as possible, so that we can refresh the big picture. We never wanna miss the forest for the trees.

Some to start are my readings organized by geographic location. The hometown (good ol' [North America](/posts/on-north-america)), the [rest of America](/posts/on-latin-america), [Asia](/posts/on-asia), [Europe](/posts/on-europe), [Africa](/posts/on-africa), [The Middle East](/posts/on-the-middle-east).

I may separate some of the thoughts on media/technology from October. I'll leave big-picture thoughts and quotes in October, but compile the larger reading lists and resources in November. [On Media](/posts/on-media) -> Media List, [On Technology](/posts/on-technology) -> technology-specific reading list, etc. (TODO, as always)

### December

December is the place for deep dives on individual leaders and topics. Breaking down from broader thoughts on an overall history to individual thoughts, perspectives, and learnings. Looking at things like how specific individuals lived their lives, how specific people have made progress in specific areas. We'll focus in from Cuba -> Che, from Russia -> Lenin, Feminism -> Porn, North America -> Ablotiion, etc. I'll still try to interlink the relevant pages as I add them. Gotta get more efficient systems for that. That's a TODO.

### January

We may see that after the original few preface months, I may use actual dates to start dating in a stricter chronological fashion. That may allow for better visibility and transparency, clearer output to the reader. But January's far away, so I have no idea what articles put in that bucket may contain. Time will tell.

TODO: outline for philosophy/october, some form of table of contents that's slightly better than this (but also not the super cool automated one on the next page)

TODO: figure out how to make this the homepage maybe
