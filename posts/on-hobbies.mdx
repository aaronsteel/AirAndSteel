I find immense values in variety. I love trying new things, because each new facet of life provides learnings about nature, about how the world works. Many of the concepts learned in one area are often applicable to others. Do you get why I keep saying learning is great yet?

Some of mine:

Academically, I come from a math and computer science background. Professionally, I've worked as a teacher and a software developer. But all forms of math, science, engineering, and building have always been passions of mine.

I love building stuff. Making robots, writing bots, designing/fabricating musical instruments, woodworking beds and tables.

While I don't consider corporate software development a ~hobby~, per se, I do spend a BUNCH of my time on it every week. So I try to learn all I can, do my best. I've gotten interesting perspectives on the worlds of finance and technology through my professional career, and I've been able to meet and talk to many interesting people through work. I can try to make the environment better at work and via my work, as much as possible. Wherever you find yourself, 

I play music. My parents, very thoughtfully, forced me to play piano growing up. I hated it. Didn't practice. (Liked the theory bits, funny enough, most of that is actually just math). Quit when I was a teen. Though I've loved ~listening~ to music my entire life, thoroughly. During the pandemic, I was alone in an apartment for six months and picked up the guitar. Played a lot, got kinda good, then it got fun. Got back into playing the piano, got a bit into recording and writing and even singing occasionally.

Exercising is a recent hobby, one I wish I fostered more growing up, but one I'm glad I'm fostering now. [shame to not see a man at his strongest by socrates or whoever; mao on exercise]. I run, when I can force myself, but I love walking around ny and climbing (rope and bouldering, with an occasional deep water solo when given the opportunity). I ski and I golf occasionally, very bougie and environmentally questionable, I'm sorry, I know. I'll try anything though, from biking to hiking to wrestling.

I try to enjoy food. It's my (and my family's) way of learning and sharing culture, there are so many interesting cuisines to try. I'm not a great chef, but I do make my attempts. I'll get better with time (I must believe).

I've played some video games. I enjoy em. Notably:
- Hearthstone. Probably the only video game I'd really consider myself good at. 
- Super Auto Pets. I'm solid at this one as well, but it's hard to know for sure because there's no competitive ladder. 
- Similar with Slay the Spire, hard to know if I'm actually good because it's a singleplayer with too many ascensions to finish - but I've spent enough time to have learned from the game. Roguelites in general give a nice sense of learning and improvement. (Hades was fun too!)
- Breath of the Wild.
- Hidden in Plain Sight.
- A short hike.

I do a bunch of (minor expeditions) into visual arts. I've tried my hand at origami, kirigami, painting, sketching, doodling, photography, graphic design, embroidery, fashion (ie. trying to look cool).

I've recently gotten into birdwatching. I used to despise the pigeons, just a few years ago. They don't get out of your way, they're too used to humans. There's a lot of nature in ny, and it's all trying it's hardest to survive in the world we all find ourselves in. We need to foster a good environment for all of it, for all of us.

I guess I also practice writing in various forms. Getting more into it recently. Here, texting, telling stories. Journalling to gain clarity on my own thoughts. Note-taking and list-making to remember things and keep organized. Sending cards and emails to check-in, reach-out, express gratitude, ask questions, ...
