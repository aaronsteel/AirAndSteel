## Bail and Criminalization tweets

### Bail

From Arielle Ivy ([@ArielleIvy_](https://twitter.com/ArielleIvy_)) on her thread [here](https://twitter.com/ArielleIvy_/status/1584677755484094467?t=9w45M6pLSoumbWJOHl-TQQ&s=19):

> Today I watched a judge get upset b/c an attorney said during a bail application that the family had not been able to save enough money to buy their loved one’s freedom. She didn’t like that characterization of bail. Which leads me to ask, what do judges think bail is?
>
> Bail is LITERALLY a sum required to be paid for a person’s freedom. Is the bench so high folks lose touch with reality once they ascend to it?

Let's all you and me remember what bail is as well; it can be easy to forget, if you don't often interact with it personally.

### Criminalization Culture

From Roderic Day ([@RodericDay](https://twitter.com/RodericDay)) on his thread [here](https://twitter.com/RodericDay/status/1584373120924004355?t=GrErlCpYhKu9bPMdOfdbag&s=19):

> Disagreements about habits are so suffused in terror of criminalization that Westies can't have chill discussions about them without panicking.
> 
> > "Watching this movie is bad for
your self-esteem."
> >
> > "YOU WANT TO BAN ART!?"
>
> > "Weed makes you sluggish."
> >
> > "YOU WANT TO JAIL ME!?"
>
> I consider being able to work out a disagreement with a good friend an *essential* life skill.
>
> And I mean reaching a satisfying resolution that settles the dispute, not deferring it forever with a lazy "agree to disagree" non-conclusion.
>
> It's the main driver of growth.
>
> Dealing with unjust authority is the most embittering thing in the world.
>
> But the salve that America offers its victims is just childish metaphysical egoism.
>
> "Be yourself!" it insists, flattering you into ignoring whether your habits contribute to your predicament.

### Old lady on the NY Metro - Oct 25, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/FelipeDLH/status/1584887584307961862))

From Felipe De La Hoz ([@FelipeDLH](https://twitter.com/FelipeDLH)) who covers immigration news on substack at [Border/Lines](https://borderlines.substack.com/):

> On a train where a small older woman was muttering incoherently to herself. To be crystal clear, she was standing still, not harassing or even addressing anyone in particular. Doors open, two cops board and remove her, apparently at the direction of the conductor
>
> They don’t give her a reason or anything, just “black jacket? Come with us ma’am, you can take the next train, come on,” which seems like an obvious lie. A few people mutter about it, the doors close, train leaves
>
> No one was being hurt, but I guess just having some issues quietly to yourself is now grounds for removal. It’s clear that the flooding of cops into the subways has little to do with public safety, and much to do with public perception of disorder
