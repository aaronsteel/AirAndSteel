title: On Sankara
description: "Why Sankara next? I like him. I like his discipline and ideals, I like his concrete actions, I like what he stands for to this day. I like his symbolic heart and the material change he affected, and I like how he focused on improving things for those who didn't have the vantage. He's a Robin Hood type, he's a hero in my eyes. I also like that he's a fellow guitar head, that's cool too, plus he was always fitted with the military suit and beret, I mean I could list here all day"

For now, some notes from an article.

[A United Front Against Debt](https://viewpointmag.com/2018/02/01/united-front-debt-1987/) - Thomas Sankara
- Debt is neo-colonialism, in which colonizers have transformed themselves into “technical assistants.” We should rather say “technical assassins.” They present us with financing, with financial backers. As if someone’s backing could create development. We have been advised to go to these lenders. We have been offered nice financial arrangements. We have been indebted for 50, 60 years and even longer. That means we have been forced to compromise our people for over 50 years.
- We cannot accept to be told about the merit of those who repay and the mistrust toward those who do not. On the contrary, we must recognize today that it is normal for the wealthiest to be the greatest thieves. When a poor man steals it is merely a theft, a petty crime -- it is solely about survival and necessity. The rich are the ones who steal from the treasury, customs duties, and who exploit the people.
- Notes support from Fidel Castro, François Mitterrand, Gro Harlem Brundtland, Félix Houphouët-Boigny for not paying debt
- Notes that weapons are used against other Africans and that peace must be attained. The weapons bought do not reach the oppressors.
- Advocates for removing dependence on external nations, advocates to produce what they need and consume what they produce within Africa in a united front against debt.
