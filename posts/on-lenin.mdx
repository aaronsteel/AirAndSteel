For now, I'll link some works (in a logical order) and post some of my own notes for quick takeaways:
- [The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1913/mar/x01.htm) (1913) - a very concise (and arguably the best) intro to Marxism.
- [Letter To American Workers](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1918/aug/20.htm) (1918)
- [The State and Revolution](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/) (1917)
- [Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/) (1916)
- [What Is To Be Done?](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1901/witbd/) (1901)
- [articles on RedSails.org](https://redsails.org/@lenin/)
- [“Left-Wing” Communism: an Infantile Disorder](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/lwc/)
- [Freedom to Criticise and Unity of Action](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1906/may/20c.htm) (1906)

### The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism notes

1. Marxism (specifically materialist philosophy) is a continuation on other study and provides answers to prominent questions by great minds. Natural science discoveries support historical materialism where they cause idealists to revise their understanding of how the world works.
- Knowledge reflects nature; so to, social knowledge reflects the economic system of society. Politics are a superstructure on the economic foundation.
2. Marx saw relationships between people, rather than things. He understood the dynamics between the players of the game. The cornerstones here are the labor theory of value and the doctrine of surplus-value.
- By increasing the dependence on capital, capitalism creates the giant power of united labor.
3. Utopian socialism has no basis in material reality. The driving force of change has always been class struggle.
- "People always have been the foolish victims of deception and self-deception in politics, and they always will be until they have learnt to seek out the interests of some class or other behind all moral, religious, political and social phrases, declarations and promises. Champions of reforms and improvements will always be fooled by the defenders of the old order until they realise that every old institution, how ever barbarous and rotten it may appear to be, is kept going by the forces of certain ruling classes."
- Marx's philosophy and economics demonstrate the true position of the proletariat within capitalism and explain the spiritual slavery within which we exist.

### Left-Wing Communism: an Infantile Disorder notes

Should we participate in bourgeois parliaments?
- Although lefts consider parliamentarianism obsolete, the masses of proletarians are still in favor of it and are often "counter-revolutionary" - this makes it obvious that parliamentarianism is not yet politically obsolete
- It is important to understand that what is obsolete to the communists is not obsolete to a class. You must follow the actual state of the class-consciousness and preparedness of the entire class (not only of its communist vanguard), and of all the working people (not only of their advanced elements).
- Participating in bourgeois-democratic parliament helps prove its obsolescence to the masses and facilitate its successful dissolution.
- Revolutionary tactics will not develop into action without revolutionary mood and the conditions to facilitate the growth of this mood. It will be more difficult to spur revolution in Europe or the US, but it will be more difficult to continue the revolution and bring it to consummation in Russia.
