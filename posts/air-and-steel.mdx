> “You’re tense, I’m calm. You apply excessive force; I control that force through fluid motion. That means relaxing the whole body so it can react instantly without resistance — no, without thought. Do you see now? It means becoming like clear water.” (Spike Spiegel, Cowboy Bebop - see [this](https://redsails.org/on-dialectics/))

The fluidity of air, the power of steel. We'll need more quickness than water and more strength than mallets. Time's they are a-changing and, as always, we've gotta adapt to the modern era.

`Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee` sorta vibe, you get the picture?

And of course, with inspiration from my namesake, [Joey Steel](https://redsails.org/dialectical-and-historical-materialism/).

Whatever happens, happens,
