> Communists, Marxist—Leninists, need to realize or admit that they are absolutely by no means "leftists."  The Left—Right political spectrum is a bourgeois liberal construct that has no basis in reality.  The Communist political spectrum is Oppressed—Oppressor.
>
> The US ytleft is a sticky, bubbling soup of anticommunist reaction, hedonism, chauvinism, anti-intellectualism, moralism, pacifism, idealism, liberalism, imperial apologists and anarchists.  Screw that.
>
> Communists need to find the *victims of capitalism,* at the farthest margins of society and begin crafting a massline while engaging in mutual aid; there's no shortage of partywork here, so why are we the materialists affiliating in any way with Chomskyites and neo-Bernsteinians?

> Anybody remember that house in Milwaukee that the police were absolutely using to hold teenage girls they kidnapped for sex trafficking and then immediately burned down once everybody figured out what was going on and we like... Just stopped talking about?

> A really good way to not fall for Color Revolution nonsense is to simply not be a babybrain who thinks the US would ever support the will of actual human beings lmfao seriously wtf is wrong with you

> People here aren't "falling for" CIA ops in Cuba — they support US imperialism, the return of the plantation system in Cuba; its relapse to a labor camp for agricultural extraction.  Stop treating liberals like drooling babies who don't know what their own politics and goals are.
>
> The liberals have been salivating for control over Cuba since the 1800s; Jefferson supported its annexation openly.  They see it as manifest destiny, but to the east; trying to acquire it since the Polk administration.  The ideology of white supremacy long demands this expansion.
>
> Liberals can't stand to see a tropical paradise a mere 90 miles away that has so successfully rejected their hegemony, and they will tolerate nothing less than full ideological and economic control over the island.

> Call me crazy, but I think Communists should recruit people into the Communist movement by explaining Communist ideas, not by assuring reactionaries it's a safe space for their backwards, incorrect ideas.

> I don't know what is so confusing about this (well, yes I do: y'all don't fuсkin' read) but "imperialism" is an arrangement of political economy; a development of capitalism — not defined by the "vibes" of a geopolitical conflict, or your fetishistic attraction to "underdogs."
>
> For instance, the US invasion of Iraq itself was a crime, a violation of international law but the INVASION was not the imperialist part.  The imperialism came when Iraq's agriculture was gutted and Monsanto was given carte blanche over that sector, among many, many other things.
>
> You could say the invasion as a verb was imperialist people enacting those imperialist economic mechanisms in agriculture, energy etc was the outset, if mostly unspoken goal ...
>
> ... but if you want to designate Russia imperialist for whatever reason at this juncture, you'd have to prove that motive.
>
> Good luck.

> The US cotton industry is as reliant on plantation slavery as it ever was, we just pretend it's different because the slaves are prisoners and not as visible.

> "Coco Chanel was a Nazi spy, like, a fuсking enthusiastic participant, she literally sucked Nazi diсk to get the gig while living at the Paris Ritz in Vichy France" is a weird little historical fact that basically never comes up for some reason.
