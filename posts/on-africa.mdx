Alright. With Africa, the resource I go back to most heavily (and that I still probably haven't read in-full, cover-to-cover, full disclosure - just being honest) is [How Europe Underdeveloped Africa](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40630.How_Europe_Underdeveloped_Africa)

Another great author is Frantz Fanon. Check out [The Wretched of the Earth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66933.The_Wretched_of_the_Earth)!

Check out [Aimé Césaire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/86598.Discourse_on_Colonialism) - text [here](https://redsails.org/discours-sur-le-colonialisme/).

TODO: okay yeah there's a whole bunch more to talk about here! Very much
TODO: Burkina Faso, Thomas Sankara, [Women's Liberation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3039894-women-s-liberation-and-the-african-freedom-struggle), tie back in with Mao in Asia, Women hold up half the sky.
TODO: Tie all that back in with [The Woman Question](https://redsails.org/the-woman-question/), that includes LGBTQ+ folks too!
TODO: [AAPRP](https://aaprp-intl.org/overview-of-essential-aspects-of-nkrumahism-toureism-ideology-of-the-aaprp/) tie in
TODO: figure out what the heck is going on in austalia.
TODO: Kwame Ture speeches

But with that, we can kinda move back into the modern era of the [US](/posts/on-north-america), with the slave trade and new learnings in mind. We can now approach works like [Settlers](https://readsettlers.org/) and [Black Skin, White Masks](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/274392.Black_Skin_White_Masks) with the context necessary.

We can understand the behaviors of our forefathers and their enemies better in order to forge our understanding of the present, into the future. You can pretty much attack any of the articles or works mentioned so far, you've got a bit of modern history from all the continents at least (missing LOTS of details, ha, I kinda apologize and kinda don't).

Continuing on to the next geographic region on my brain: [Palestine](/posts/on-the-middle-east)
