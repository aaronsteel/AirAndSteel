My philosophical influences are spiritual, stoic, and materialist.

[Understanding life from the river (ie. Siddhartha)](/posts/on-siddhartha)

[Stoicism (ie. Aurelius)](/posts/on-meditations)

[Materialism (ie. communists all working to the same conclusions across the globe)](/posts/on-communists)

By going through those three and understanding them along the way, you'll have worked through my pathway of learning. But, full disclosure, each of those topics goes... deep. They all take time, learning anything requires some dedication.
