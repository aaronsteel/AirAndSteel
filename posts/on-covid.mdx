Alright. This post is going to be a composite of:

- current world data links
- links to current thoughts from doctors/etc about what people should do (ie. wear an n95 or better mask, especially when you're around other people who may need to be there to survive - they could be immunocompromised or otherwise vulnerable)
- strategies used around the world and results
- personal thoughts re ^

TODO: all that, and maybe more
