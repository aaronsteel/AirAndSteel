### What does organization look like? - Nov 6, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/Casswantsrevolt/status/1589312784655060994))

From Communist Anarchist Society Saboteur (C.A.S.S.) ([@Casswantsrevolt](https://twitter.com/Casswantsrevolt)):

> As a lot of people realize the need for arming up against fascist violence, a lot buy a gun and think they're good
>
> This is a mistake
>
> A single person with a gun can protect themselves against immediate violence, but they will not be able to protect themselves against the fascist movement as a whole.
>
> for that you need to be organized. But what does being organized look like?
>
> First things first, you need to find people you trust and form a group.
>
> This might seem hard  to do in our atomized world but we need to do it. Talk to your neighbors and find likeminded people, show up in your friends and comrades lives, connect and network.
>
> after you have a group you can trust, start training together. Drills, dry fire, exercise, rucking, hiking, first aid, small unit tactics etc. Train together and have fun with it. Do fun shit together to build trust. Have movie nights, potlucks, and BBQ's
>
> And for the gods sake, help your community.
>
> start a food not bombs, organize a community pantry, build a community garden. Host art and other fun events. Check up on your neighbors, repair houses, do disaster relief, start a cop watch, help train and protect the marginalized
>
> if you don't help your community, you're just a group of people with guns. With an organized community, you can do force multiplication that will help you immensely against fascist threats. A majority of your group's actions should be helping your community
>
> Another thing your group should do, intelligence. Find and dox fascists in your area. Walk, bike, skate, and drive around to learn about the layout of your area. keep an eye on local politics and fascist group's actions. Find out which people and group in your area are
>
> sympathetic, apathetic, or hostile. Network and connect with other groups in your area and work together. Learn where security cameras are Practice good security culture and PERSEC.
>
> But the major thing to prevent is yourself and your group from being filled with machismo. Your main goal isn't to be the most badass revolutionary and go out in a blaze of glory, its to help your community and survive another day. Don't be tough, be caring.
>
> Remember, if we wait for the governments, it’ll be too little, too late; if we act as individuals, it’ll be too little; but if we act as communities, it might just be enough, just in time.

> I think we often lose the forest in the trees
>
> They don't want trans people to use the "correct" bathroom, they want to make being trans in public for long stretches of time impossible
>
> They don't want to remove queerness from schools, they want to make it impossible for...
>
> ...anyone to learn about queerness ever
>
> They don't want to stop trans kids from getting hormones, they want to prevent any sort of transition ever
>
> They aren't calling us groomers because they worry about kids safety, they're constructing a narrative that allows them to kill us

> Liberals say they are progressive till you convey the slightest bit of empathy to the unhoused

> When you realize that basically the entire wizarding world is smaller than the population of Iceland the entire illusion of JK Being a good author just shatters
>
> Read Ursula K Le Guin instead
