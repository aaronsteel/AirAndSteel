## American Communists (and, y'know, similar)

Some people, in places like Oakland, had been seeing this problem for a very fucking long time. Those who mostly grow up in affluent suburbs don't see the same as the black kids in the city. Material reality shapes us, we'll get there in a minute. Check out what the [BPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_Party) did - look at this piece by [Sundiata Acoli](http://www.sundiataacoli.org/about) - [A Brief History of the Black Panther Party and Its Place In the Black Liberation Movement (2008)](https://redsails.org/a-brief-history-of-the-black-panther-party/). see what Huey P. Newton [wrote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Suicide), see what Assata [wrote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assata:_An_Autobiography) and [said](https://redsails.org/assata-and-pastors/).

But these thoughts are had worldwide. Those are just some, from black voices in Cali and Cuba. From real Amerikan political prisoners, martyrs, and asylums.

If you want the voice of the hard-working Italian-American working class, grown and raised in East Harlem, [Michael Parenti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Parenti) was very influential for me as I started the next steps of my journey (ie. post-teargas). [Blackshirts and Reds](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/404273.Blackshirts_and_Reds) and [Inventing Reality](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/673719.Inventing_Reality) were the most influential. But even [The Assassination of Julius Caesar](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37811.The_Assassination_of_Julius_Caesar) posed thought provoking ideas about information from my old latin classes. For the quick intro on Parenti, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP8CzlFhc14) - well-known in some circles as `yellow parenti` - is a lecture from 1986. It's a great start, it helped me when I was figuring out how to live life.

Think about these when you think `intersectionality`; think about these when you understand your childhood, as you process trauma.
