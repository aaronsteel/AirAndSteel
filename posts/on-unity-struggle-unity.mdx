## Unity-Struggle-Unity

[Unity-Struggle-Unity](https://unity-struggle-unity.org/) is "a Marxist-Leninist press publishing the Red Clarion, Crucible, and the Unity Journal". ([@USUMLPress](https://twitter.com/USUMLPress))

Although I've just been introduced to the effort and I haven't (yet) read much of the Red Clarion, I do want to share the site already.

I think their [Contributor’s Guide](https://unity-struggle-unity.org/submissions/contributors-guide-the-red-clarion) is a great read, and it's helped me focus the scope/audience of my own site as I build it out. I highly recommend reading it if you have your own stories to tell; it may lend useful perspective from fellow authors who share a goal and mindset.

Along with that, they provide a helpful [Glossary of Marxism-Leninism](https://unity-struggle-unity.org/glossary-of-marxism-leninism/) that may come in handy, especially for newer comrades.

## The Red Clarion

The Red Clarion itself is available [here](https://unity-struggle-unity.org/clarion/). There's a variety of content, from news and analysis to book reviews and poetry.
