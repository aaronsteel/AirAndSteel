## Prole Academy

[Prole Academy](https://www.proleacademy.com/) is a "radical book blog for working people in a hurry" - they outline Marxist theory in order to give workers quick overviews of books and concepts, to help them start their education.

Although I found them on twitter, I won't link their threads since they're image heavy - the same content can be found on their website.

Their site has [briefings](https://www.proleacademy.com/reviews/series/briefings/)  - in-depth looks at a concept, event, or person that matters, designed to be read with as much or as little time as you have. You can find their first briefing series at [Marxism 101](https://www.proleacademy.com/reviews/series/marxism-101/).

They also have [book reviews](https://www.proleacademy.com/latest-posts/review/) on leftist works. From classics like [State and Rev](https://www.proleacademy.com/review/the-state-and-revolution-vladimir-lenin/) to modern works like David Graeber's [Bullshit Jobs](https://www.proleacademy.com/review/bullshit-jobs-david-graeber/), they provide quick one-pagers and highlights to get caught up in brief. Although I always recommend referencing the originals (as you should with anything you read on my site), summaries and articles can be a great place to start. So, thanks to Benjamin Walker and the folks at Prole Academy for trying to make theory more accessible to the masses!

They also have a [bookshelf](https://www.proleacademy.com/bookshelf/), [courses](https://www.proleacademy.com/course-listing/), a [blog](https://www.proleacademy.com/blog/), some [about info](https://www.proleacademy.com/about-us/), and a [buymeacoffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ProleAcademy) if you want to support their efforts.
