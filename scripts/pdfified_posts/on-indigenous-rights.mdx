## Books

I suppose Howard Zinn's _A People's History of the United States_ is always a good start to learning about the history of the US, and I think Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz's _An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States_ is a great follow-up to get an indigenous perspective.

> non indigenous leftists dont understand how big of a deal ICWA is. the future of all native nations rests on the results of this challenge to ICWA. the future of this fucking planet being habitable is going to be determined by this. n if u think for a second natives are gonna allow our kin to be ripped away from us en masse after all the work weve been doing to rebuild what was genocided out of us u got another thing comin. this could trigger something HUGE....

From [@notdbird](https://twitter.com/notdbird), bio "Oglala Lakota. Ina. Pine Ridge Rez-raised. Oxford comma fan. Views are my own. she/her."

> When my youngest was nine months old, he was in the cruising stage of learning to walk. He fell and hit his head. We’d baby proofed the house and had his cruising contained in a very small area. We took him to the ER and before they even examined him, they filed a CPS report.
>
> Husband, who is very Native looking, was the one to take him in. They treated him like a criminal and tried to separate him from our son. He refused. I called my sister who works w/the ICWA advocate for our tribe. They were ready for fight for us to keep him, an Oglala baby.
>
> After the doctors reviewed the CT and subjected our baby to a massive, painful full body check for signs of child abuse, they told us our “story checked out.” According to the records, however, they didn’t share that with CPS. We lived in fear for months. This was in ND.
>
> We could’ve lost our child over a common childhood injury. Husband was treated like a big scary child abuser despite being a gentle, loving father. And when the doctors apologized, they apologized to me, the light skinned Native with more Euro features. It was disgusting.
>
> ICWA matters. These states actively work to separate Native kids from their families. White friends have taken their kids in for similar injuries and weren’t threatened. 
>
> We aren’t safe. We are afraid every time we take our kids to the doctor. The medical system is complicit.

> My #ICWA agent is the only reason I was able to escape an abusive foster home. I was placed with a white woman by the Office of Children’s services Wasilla. My ICWA agent literally saved me, and I know she did the same for other native children. #ProtectICWA
>
> When my younger brother was being rehomed by the same Alaska Office of Children’s Services, the only reason I was considered for his temporary placement was his #ICWA agent! These people fight for the rights of Indigenous children every day and protect us from abuse!
>
> Native children are being STOLEN and ABUSED by the government every day TO THIS DAY! It didn’t stop with the end of residential schools. ITS STILL HAPPENING! And that is why we need to #ProtectICWA #ICWA
>
> To urge your government officals to act, text PCCPGW to 50409 and follow prompts! It sends a letter to your state officals and can all be done in your text messages.
>
> Sign and share these petitions to help protect #ICWA!
