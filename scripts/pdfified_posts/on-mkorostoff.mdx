## Wealth shown to scale

My introduction to Matt's work was his [wealth visualization (via mkorostoff.github.io)](https://mkorostoff.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/).

It uses one pixel to represent $1000, and demonstrates other major milestones (median US household income, average lifetime wealth, etc. in comparison to Jeff Bezos' wealth). I think it's a great visualization and a well-made resource, so shoutout to Matt for his great work. I can't state enough how much I respect and admire projects like these.

## Incarceration in real numbers

Which brings us to another great project, a [visualization of the number of Americans jailed or imprisoned (via mkorostoff.github.io)](https://mkorostoff.github.io/incarceration-in-real-numbers/).

## Faces of Covid-19

And a project related to Covid, Matt also created a [visualization of the 535,000 Americans who died of Covid in the first year of the pandemic](https://mkorostoff.github.io/hundred-thousand-faces/) 

In his words,

> In the first year of the global pandemic, COVID-19 killed around 535,000 Americans, a number that defies comprehension. This website is intended to help visitors understand the massive scale of this event by putting a human face on each person lost. It is my hope that this will allow visitors to understand the death toll as more than just a number.

## 8 minutes 46 seconds

A project related to the death of George Floyd, Matt created a [timer to fully realize the reality of the killing (via 8m46s.com)](https://8m46s.com/).

> On May 25th 2020, Derek Chauvin held his knee on the neck of George Floyd for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, resulting in Mr. Floyd's death. I invite visitors to sit quietly and reflect for this same length of time. It feels like an eternity. A partial transcript of the incident is provided throughout.

## Site

The rest of Matt's work (serious, unserious, and computer) can be found on his site: [mattkorostoff.com/](https://mattkorostoff.com/).

I also really enjoyed [Factory Factory Factory](https://factoryfactoryfactory.net/), aka "Modern Software Development Summarized", originally titled "Why I Hate Frameworks" by Benji Smith and maintained on that domain by Matt.
