## Asia (with a focus on Korea, China, and Vietnam)

For Korean perspective on Socialism, check out a bunch of Kim Il-Sung's speeches [here](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60734264-socialist-education-in-korea). There's a reason he's a hero of the people, he has valuable perspective to share as a guerilla leader.



TODO: quote, che, everyone arrives at marxism through observing nature and drawing their own conclusions
TODO: quote, Korean/Cuban about the shared stuggle
TODO: Pachinko
TODO: Vietnam / Ho. RedSails, how I arrived at the third international (ie. which was the party that stood against imperialism. eventually understanding Lenin's words. pull quote, also link.)
TODO: Laos

Continuing on from Korea but staying within Asia (and also suffering under the outward expansion of Imperial Japan), China!

That isn't even getting to the real starts. For that, we'd have to get Europe, to Marx. Following the Paris Commune, in Germany. Then Lenin, in Russia. Working hard and coming up with the Leninism part of the Marxism-Leninism. His four works are essential. And finally, Stalin, the synthesizer of Marxism-Leninism.

To move forward, we'll go back to the "start": Europe time, let's talk about [Germany and Russia](/posts/on-europe)
