### Starbucks - Nov 1, 2022

Just a couple days ago, on November 1st 2022, Starbucks Workers United ([@SBWorkersUnited](https://twitter.com/SBWorkersUnited)) posted updates [here](https://twitter.com/SBWorkersUnited/status/1587530037443678210?t=8uPVCxI-kUTL7tvmn7kfqQ&s=19):

> UNION WINS THREAD ALERT: Less than a year ago, there were ZERO unionized Starbucks stores in the US. Today, there are 258! Let’s take a look at some of the incredible things workers have fought for and WON over the past year…
>
> One of our first public demands was fighting for seniority pay for baristas. How did Starbucks respond? By implementing the first seniority pay in the company’s 50 year history.
>
> Union workers raised the issue of inadequate and failing equipment. What were we able to pressure the company into doing? Store renovations ACROSS the country, including new ovens.
>
> After working through a global pandemic, our campaign demanded that workers get paid a living wage. Starbucks acquiesced to our demands and implemented a $15 minimum wage across the country.
>
> Stores that have been closed, that have unionized, are able to bargain with the company to ensure that partners are transferred to a preferred location and are able to keep their guaranteed hours.
>
> One of the first proposals that unionized Starbucks workers in Elmwood brought to the company was a policy on a more tolerant dress code. Soon after this proposal was presented, Starbucks implemented our ideas at stores nation-wide.
>
> Another one of our proposals that Starbucks has implemented across the country is faster sick time accrual, which is something that unionized workers have been advocating for since the very beginning of our campaign.
>
> Our campaign is responsible for the removal of Kevin Johnson as CEO of Starbucks and ushering in almost an entirely new C-Suite of Starbucks executives. Union-busters like Rossann Williams & John Culver have both left (or are leaving) the company.
>
> Not only did our campaign pressure Starbucks to implement long overdue changes, but we continue to make the company concede to our demands by striking and other actions.
>
> For example, the campaign’s action have resulted in bad managers being removed from stores, the purchasing of new equipment, and acceptance of workers’ availability.
>
> And these are all things that we accomplished even without a contract! Union partners continue the fight for everything from adequate staffing to better benefits to health and safety at work.
>
> Starbucks doesn’t want us to organize because they know that when we organize, we win.
>
> Despite Starbucks trying to do everything to stop us from organizing, partners continue to stand up, fight back, and organize. If this is all that we won less than a year into our campaign, just imagine the possibilities of what is to come.

Great work to the workers of Starbucks! Here's the Starbucks Workers United [bit.ly](https://bit.ly/m/sbworkersunited) with links to their site and resources.

### Starbucks: externalities - Oct 23, 2022

Though we can see workers gaining power at these Starbucks, that didn't come easy. As we see from an ex-Starbucks employee in Ithaca, NY ([@valleyboyboy](https://twitter.com/valleyboyboy)) [here](https://twitter.com/valleyboyboy/status/1584304485148798976):

> My life is terrible since Starbucks fired me. I can't get a job despite filling out every app I can. I have no money. My internet is out bc non payment. It has caused irreparable damage to my mental health. All because I started a union.
>
> This company is evil. I have no backup plan. No family to help. I have lived off gofundme money until understandably people couldn't give anymore.
>
> I have nobody. No friends. Every day is bad. I can't even watch movies. My one refuge. I have to cancel all my services now.
>
> I am losing my stability. I will have no home. All because I took a chance to make my workplace better for myself and my coworkers.
>
> Starbucks doesn't care. None of the management that pretended to be my family for years reached out in any way.
>
> Now I'm rotting in poverty.
>
> Fuck you @Starbucks

I'm sorry to hear these stories (and worse) constantly as I see workers try to fight for their rights across the US and the world. The callous treatment demonstrates, _clearly_, the necessity of unions and stronger worker protections. It should not be possible for corporations to inflict poverty upon workers who are struggling to survive!

### re: twitter - Nov 2, 2022

As Anne V Clark ([@annevclark](https://twitter.com/annevclark)) says [here](https://twitter.com/annevclark/status/1587815235469066241?t=iI1B3ulwTNVOLhZAWBujMw&s=19):

> The reason unions are badass is if a billionaire walks into your office and starts demanding you work 12 hours a day 7 days a week to prove to him you deserve your job, you and your coworkers can legally make that one of the worst days of his life.
>
> Make Elon write all the code! From what I understand he's some kind of genius who never sleeps! Should be easy for him!
>
> > Employer: we don't think we need you!
> >
> > Employees: okay (goes home)
> >
> > Employer: no wait
>
> COUGH COUGH [https://code-cwa.org](https://code-cwa.org)

Thanks Anne, for the good points, and sorry to all the workers who have been crawling through the mud at twitter to keep the site running through what I understand to have been a hellish year. Your work is appreciated, as are you. Maybe not from above, but from some guy writing his little website. Thanks, really.
