# On The Fall of Twitter

## Huh?

Well. It's November 4th. Twitter has just gone through a major round of layoffs, as have a few other companies while they can escape scrutiny.

As [@Foone](https://twitter.com/Foone) says [here](https://twitter.com/Foone/status/1588429889107296256?t=r5XrHQb2-Hn5GMwpZo2vPw&s=19):

> As a former SRE, I'd just like to say:
This site isn't going to burn down. That's way too calm and organized a death for a site this big which apparently just fired most of the on-call staff.
>
> That's more like it.
> It's going to evaporate, not like a puddle on a hot day, but like a couple tons of steel that's just met an atomic shockwave
>
> We're going to need high speed cameras to even see the blast as anything more than a single frame of white and then devastation as far as the eye can see.
>
> This site is going to melt.
>
> It's actually funny in retrospect how people have been talking about how the changes to verification and unbanning certain people is going to drive people off Twitter as they lose trust in the platform...
>
> It's not going to last long enough for that to even matter!
>
> This is a great example of what's going to happen. It's not going to get hacked or have servers catch fire, but something small and unexpected is going to take it down and they'll be unable to find someone to unfuck it:
> > Right now a disk is filling up on a server somewhere in some data center that a person who has just been laid off has been manually clearing every few days and when that disk fills up Twitter will go down.

So I'm trying to get all my useful info and links off of there before they're lost forever. Why does it always feel like I'm racing against time trying to build as things crumble? Anyway.

TODO: sort these into the relevant articles, tags, everything, organize, organize, organize all the resources

---

To start, this maybe isn't related specifically to twitter, but I feel it's relevant. From Dan Waterfield ([@danwaterfield](https://twitter.com/danwaterfield)) [here](https://twitter.com/danwaterfield/status/1587900573055082497?t=VxaVVQkBABheS2w9kwjQyg&s=19):

> I would argue that this is what state collapse looks like btw. A slow inability to build new things, to look after the populace, to repair infrastructure. Essentials get more expensive. The elite retreat to enclaves and gated communities.
>
> State becomes less and less able to respond to natural disasters.

I think that's applicable enough to the twitter situation, though I'm not sure that's what Dan was originally referencing. If/when twitter falls, there is no recourse. Under private ownership, with a lack of regulation or accountability, we can lose millions of hours of community time, thought, and effort. Just because the richest guy around wanted to meme around and buy a website, wreak havoc on the workers for a little good time.

We (see: [On Uniting](/posts/on-uniting)) need to be building and maintaining our own infrastructure, in order to prevent it from being destroyed at the whim of those at the top.

For right now I'm being a bit of a modern librarian on my silly little site. I am trying to salvage and reclaim, in this moment. But we need to build systems for the people, and we need to have been building em 20 years ago. The only time is now.

## z-lib

In the vein of failing infrastructure, I also just heard of the fall of z-lib. From [@juwugoslavija](https://twitter.com/juwugoslavija) [here](https://twitter.com/juwugoslavija/status/1588486265301008384?t=2VUfnbXV5yoW5ovbd2OgXw&s=19)

> z library being gone is literally the worst day ever why am i abt to cry at jfk international airport

From [@postcardofexile](https://twitter.com/postcardofexile) on [this](https://twitter.com/postcardofexile/status/1588516388137709569?t=21y8G7pUrmCtF8wDE9PLXw&s=19) post:

> Zlibrary died today, it was shut down by the gatekeepers in the global north. This cruel gatekeeping of sources of knowledge and learning enrages me. So many of us do not have access to libraries (digital and physical) and it was our only source to write books and articles.
>
> Whenever books are not available at my local stores, I had turned to Zlib. I understand as a writer we need royalties and payments, but the joy of hearing someone say that a writing made them feel something, I would take that over anything. I would rather be read and read.
>
> knowledge production should not be limited to those with ivy league and oxbridge degrees, and the libraries these schools give access to. this enrages me because curiosity to learn and question critically is then shut down. Narratives will narrow down and voices limited.
>
> There are so many books that I couldn’t have read while writing this novel, and were only available on these libraries. How do they expect anyone in the global south to compete with novelists who have art grants, access to residencies, and libraries, mentors and archives.

and as many have said, including [@mshadimas](https://twitter.com/mshadimas) [here](https://twitter.com/mshadimas/status/1588417930630684672):

> zlib going down is like the modern day burning of the library of alexandria

Again, may we collect our materials and rebuild our resources. There's so much work to be done.

## Alec Karakatsanis

[@equalityAlec](https://twitter.com/equalityAlec), bio [here](https://civilrightscorps.org/alec-karakatsanis-founder-executive-director/) on his site Civil Rights Corp.

He's had a few good threads, so I'm keeping this as a tracker to remember his writing and work.

> [THREAD](https://twitter.com/equalityAlec/status/1584570222274842624?t=tcRyT7W_xpx1pp5fZF4wpg&s=19).  This weekend, the New York Times published misinformation it knew to be false. Because the stakes are so high, I try my best to explain what the paper did why it is so dangerous.

> [THREAD](https://twitter.com/equalityAlec/status/1588210962867314689?t=ap1BwHhUCvqQoNg4pRBtbw&s=19). Two Harvard professors published an academic article calling for 500,000 more armed cops, who they say will arrest 7.8 million more people per year. The article reveals alarming flaws in elite academia at a time of rising fascism. This is one of my most important posts.

## Community and Uniting

This is just a thought I like to consider, from rafael diaz ([@goodfriendraf](https://twitter.com/goodfriendraf))

> can’t help but feel more and more convinced that we’re so alienated from one another that we need to take on serious efforts just to rebuild community itself before we’re able to get much out of trying to organize it

## Unions

### Starbucks

Just a couple days ago, on November 1st 2022, Starbucks Workers United ([@SBWorkersUnited](https://twitter.com/SBWorkersUnited)) posted updates [here](https://twitter.com/SBWorkersUnited/status/1587530037443678210?t=8uPVCxI-kUTL7tvmn7kfqQ&s=19):

> UNION WINS THREAD ALERT: Less than a year ago, there were ZERO unionized Starbucks stores in the US. Today, there are 258! Let’s take a look at some of the incredible things workers have fought for and WON over the past year…
>
> One of our first public demands was fighting for seniority pay for baristas. How did Starbucks respond? By implementing the first seniority pay in the company’s 50 year history.
>
> Union workers raised the issue of inadequate and failing equipment. What were we able to pressure the company into doing? Store renovations ACROSS the country, including new ovens.
>
> After working through a global pandemic, our campaign demanded that workers get paid a living wage. Starbucks acquiesced to our demands and implemented a $15 minimum wage across the country.
>
> Stores that have been closed, that have unionized, are able to bargain with the company to ensure that partners are transferred to a preferred location and are able to keep their guaranteed hours.
>
> One of the first proposals that unionized Starbucks workers in Elmwood brought to the company was a policy on a more tolerant dress code. Soon after this proposal was presented, Starbucks implemented our ideas at stores nation-wide.
>
> Another one of our proposals that Starbucks has implemented across the country is faster sick time accrual, which is something that unionized workers have been advocating for since the very beginning of our campaign.
>
> Our campaign is responsible for the removal of Kevin Johnson as CEO of Starbucks and ushering in almost an entirely new C-Suite of Starbucks executives. Union-busters like Rossann Williams & John Culver have both left (or are leaving) the company.
>
> Not only did our campaign pressure Starbucks to implement long overdue changes, but we continue to make the company concede to our demands by striking and other actions.
>
> For example, the campaign’s action have resulted in bad managers being removed from stores, the purchasing of new equipment, and acceptance of workers’ availability.
>
> And these are all things that we accomplished even without a contract! Union partners continue the fight for everything from adequate staffing to better benefits to health and safety at work.
>
> Starbucks doesn’t want us to organize because they know that when we organize, we win.
>
> Despite Starbucks trying to do everything to stop us from organizing, partners continue to stand up, fight back, and organize. If this is all that we won less than a year into our campaign, just imagine the possibilities of what is to come.

Great work to the workers of Starbucks! Here's the Starbucks Workers United [bit.ly](https://bit.ly/m/sbworkersunited) with links to their site and resources.

### Starbucks: externalities

Though we can see workers gaining power at these Starbucks, that didn't come easy. As we see from an ex-Starbucks employee in Ithaca, NY ([@valleyboyboy](https://twitter.com/valleyboyboy)):

> My life is terrible since Starbucks fired me. I can't get a job despite filling out every app I can. I have no money. My internet is out bc non payment. It has caused irreparable damage to my mental health. All because I started a union.
>
> This company is evil. I have no backup plan. No family to help. I have lived off gofundme money until understandably people couldn't give anymore.
>
> I have nobody. No friends. Every day is bad. I can't even watch movies. My one refuge. I have to cancel all my services now.
>
> I am losing my stability. I will have no home. All because I took a chance to make my workplace better for myself and my coworkers.
>
> Starbucks doesn't care. None of the management that pretended to be my family for years reached out in any way.
>
> Now I'm rotting in poverty.
>
> Fuck you @Starbucks

I'm sorry to hear these stories (and worse) constantly as I see workers try to fight for their rights across the US and the world. The callous treatment demonstrates, _clearly_, the necessity of unions and stronger worker protections. It should not be possible for corporations to inflict poverty upon workers who are struggling to survive!

### re: twitter

As Anne V Clark ([@annevclark](https://twitter.com/annevclark)) says [here](https://twitter.com/annevclark/status/1587815235469066241?t=iI1B3ulwTNVOLhZAWBujMw&s=19):

> The reason unions are badass is if a billionaire walks into your office and starts demanding you work 12 hours a day 7 days a week to prove to him you deserve your job, you and your coworkers can legally make that one of the worst days of his life.
>
> Make Elon write all the code! From what I understand he's some kind of genius who never sleeps! Should be easy for him!
>
> > Employer: we don't think we need you!
> >
> > Employees: okay (goes home)
> >
> > Employer: no wait
>
> COUGH COUGH [https://code-cwa.org](https://code-cwa.org)

Thanks Anne, for the good points, and sorry to all the workers who have been crawling through the mud at twitter to keep the site running through what I understand to have been a hellish year. Your work is appreciated, as are you. Maybe not from above, but from some guy writing his little website. Thanks, really.

## Bail and Criminalization

### Bail

From Arielle Ivy ([@ArielleIvy_](https://twitter.com/ArielleIvy_)) on her thread [here](https://twitter.com/ArielleIvy_/status/1584677755484094467?t=9w45M6pLSoumbWJOHl-TQQ&s=19):

> Today I watched a judge get upset b/c an attorney said during a bail application that the family had not been able to save enough money to buy their loved one’s freedom. She didn’t like that characterization of bail. Which leads me to ask, what do judges think bail is?
>
> Bail is LITERALLY a sum required to be paid for a person’s freedom. Is the bench so high folks lose touch with reality once they ascend to it?

Let's all you and me remember what bail is as well; it can be easy to forget, if you don't often interact with it personally.

### Criminalization Culture

From Roderic Day ([@RodericDay](https://twitter.com/RodericDay)) on his thread [here](https://twitter.com/RodericDay/status/1584373120924004355?t=GrErlCpYhKu9bPMdOfdbag&s=19):

> Disagreements about habits are so suffused in terror of criminalization that Westies can't have chill discussions about them without panicking.
> 
> > "Watching this movie is bad for
your self-esteem."
> >
> > "YOU WANT TO BAN ART!?"
>
> > "Weed makes you sluggish."
> >
> > "YOU WANT TO JAIL ME!?"
>
> I consider being able to work out a disagreement with a good friend an *essential* life skill.
>
> And I mean reaching a satisfying resolution that settles the dispute, not deferring it forever with a lazy "agree to disagree" non-conclusion.
>
> It's the main driver of growth.
>
> Dealing with unjust authority is the most embittering thing in the world.
>
> But the salve that America offers its victims is just childish metaphysical egoism.
>
> "Be yourself!" it insists, flattering you into ignoring whether your habits contribute to your predicament.

### Old lady on the NY Metro - Oct 25, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/FelipeDLH/status/1584887584307961862))

From Felipe De La Hoz ([@FelipeDLH](https://twitter.com/FelipeDLH)) who covers immigration news on substack at [Border/Lines](https://borderlines.substack.com/):

> On a train where a small older woman was muttering incoherently to herself. To be crystal clear, she was standing still, not harassing or even addressing anyone in particular. Doors open, two cops board and remove her, apparently at the direction of the conductor
>
> They don’t give her a reason or anything, just “black jacket? Come with us ma’am, you can take the next train, come on,” which seems like an obvious lie. A few people mutter about it, the doors close, train leaves
>
> No one was being hurt, but I guess just having some issues quietly to yourself is now grounds for removal. It’s clear that the flooding of cops into the subways has little to do with public safety, and much to do with public perception of disorder

## Climate and Energy

### Climate Collapse - Oct 22, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/MarxistHeathen/status/1583924752921468929))

A thread made by HeathenCommunist ([@MarxistHeathen](https://twitter.com/MarxistHeathen)), a CPUSA member in Arizona:

> Climate collapse is not one issue among many or another social ill that we need to defeat capitalism before dealing with. Before anything and everything else: it’s deadline.
>
> Shifting our focus to it isn’t about making it the most important “issue”. It’s not an “issue”.
>
> It’s a material condition that MUST shape the *entirety* of our strategy like a frame. That doesn’t mean we talk about it more than anything else. It just means it’s always on our mind when strategizing, even if we don’t say it.
>
> What does revolution mean when it’s not just a matter of liberation but total survival?
>
> What do scientific socialism and experimentation mean when we no longer have the time to “try again”?
>
> What does it mean for internal contradictions among our enemy when *they* know this and *they* know that working with us to actually defeat the other camp be defeated by us would be their death sentence?
>
> What does it mean for revolutionary strategy when asking the question of “how can we accomplish this” is an obsolete question, replaced by “how can we accomplish this in time”?
>
> What does it mean when we can’t afford another setback? When we can’t afford another century of struggle?
>
> What does it mean when believing revolution won’t happen in our lifetime stops being the planting of trees whose shade we will never sit under & is now accepting that our grandchildren will have no shade to sit in?
>
> Historical socialist strategy was premised on laying the groundwork for future struggle when it could not find a way to achieve its aims.
>
> How do we cope with the fact that we *are* that future generation that groundwork was laid for? That, if we can’t find a way to achieve our aims, that our only option is to keep looking until we find it?

## Writing

### Originally by inkskinned on tumblr

> Every day I handle more money than I will ever make. Every day.
>
> At the start of my employment, my boss showed me videos of people stealing, and we both had a chuckle about it. How silly they were! There was a camera overhead. and it's not to watch the shoppers. See, we can't actually stop shoplifters. They get away with it maybe nine out of ten times. But we, who are all watched and tallied and witnessed? We are always caught.
>
> At first it was hard to hold one hundred dollar bills. An amount I had never seen before. An amount that didn't exist in my household. It's normal now. Here is something that is not for me.
>
> 'What the hell, I'll take another,' says the man, pondering out 200 dollar watches. What the hell. Total comes to 580 and not even a flinch in his face. I have been working for 11 hours today and made only 110 dollars. It will go to my rent. Today I work for free, it feels. When I get my check, I will have 35 dollars left for food and saving.
>
> The six hundreds he hands me go into the cash register. For a moment, I imagine having money. Then I put it away, counting out his change.
>
> I know for a fact we sell out products for double what they are worth. That I could be making commission. That they could hand me those 580 dollars and change my life and not even mark the difference in their checkbooks. He's not the only sale they make today, but I am the reason they made it. He's not the only one spending 600 dollars, but if I hadn't spent two hours with him telling me about his life, he wouldn't have spent any. I go home. I don't own a watch.
>
> I have watched and rewatched a video on how to make salmon four ways. My shopping list is always the same. Pasta. Rice. Tuna. If I can afford butter it was a good week. I dream of the world I will never walk in, where I can throw the best fish fillet in the cart with a shrug. I hold hundreds in my hand and look up at the camera. I put them under the cash drawer.
>
> I go to work. I scrap together my savings. I eat my bowl of rice slowly. My manager takes a paid week off from work just for this birthday. He owns a yacht.
>
> I'm not worth the cost of a watch.
