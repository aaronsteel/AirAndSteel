### "My lifelong passion, I guess, if I had to pick _one_ lifelong passion in some arbitrary hypothetical."

You can pick up learnings from everywhere. Many people are saying the same thing, because they make the same observations of nature.

Dialectics:
"Snowball"
Gibbons quote - wealthy are able to do well due to their abundance of resources, from Parenti (Julius Caesar?)
Engels and Enlai and Castro grew up as members of exploiting classes and nevertheless used their resources to build positive change - at the expense of their personal wealth.

Community:
both the rich and the poor understand "networking" and the importance of human connections [Parasite]

Folks like Matt Levine and Michael Lewis are very good thinkers in their respective fields. Whether or not you see exactly eye-to-eye with them, you can probably learn something from the way they think and describe the world.

Folks like Guevara and Mao give fighters' perspectives, as did Nkrumah and Jackson. Engels that of an every-man, Aurelius that of an emperor, Lundy Bancroft that of a psychologist dedicated to a specific subfield. 

Seriousness:
"Stay Hungry"
"Carpe Diem"
"Whatever happens, happens"
"What is to be done?"
"Memento Mori"
"Time is Money"



If you read enough of a variety, you'll find who you tend to agree with the most. They'll probably self-describe their ideology and alignment, and I have an idea [and hope] you'll figure out which group is fighting the hardest, for the most. That exercise is left to the reader.
