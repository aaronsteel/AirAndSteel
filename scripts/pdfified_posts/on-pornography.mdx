### "full disclosure: I'm anti"

---

Where to begin. I'll speak first to the young readers, because they're the most inexperienced and thus the most in need of guidance. But some of these topics are taboo, and I fear lots of folks haven't gotten guidance of this type well into their adulthood.

- Porn is not sex. Porn is not even really like sex. You shouldn't copy what you see in porn, and you should do your best to remember that any potential partners you interact with aren't going to be picture-perfect like some of the edited videos you're used to. They are real humans, who do not exist for your sexual pleasure. You are a real human, who does not exist for anyone else's sexual pleasure.
- Porn propagates unhealthy images of sexuality, women, gender identities, minorities, misogyny, motherhood, family, ...
- Porn is the commodification of sex, and it's dangerously addictive (especially in times when people are lonely and isolated, especially in times when dating is at low points due to lack of access [ie. people are busy and also don't have money and also often live with their parents till later] and the commodification of dating [ie. apps that can exacerbate gender tensions and unhealthy gender dynamics; apps that cause people to question their worth and their options])
- The instant access to an infinite amount of sexual commodification is dangerous to consumers. Porn consumption makes people hypersexual. It makes men get erectile dysfunction at increasingly young ages. It makes people dissatisfied with their real sexual relationships, in favor of internet images.
- It is much more dangerous to those involved in sex work. From young girls being trafficked into prostitution and for the production of pornography, to prostitutes who deal with violent clients, to women who are being forced to produce OnlyFans videos by their partner or pimp. These are (many of) the exploited people (predominantly women and girls, but men and boys as well) who generate the body of images and videos utilized for pornography. These are the people I am speaking for, first and foremost.

Very succinctly:

1) Porn necessitates sexual violence for its production in the current iteration of society. ie. you are (often) watching children and teenagers being raped when you consume pornography.
2) The increasing access to pornography (prevalence of internet-access devices, at younger and younger ages) is causing people (especially boys and young men) to develop unhealthy images of sexuality, relationships, women, and gender/racial minorities. It is extraordinarily dangerous [media](/posts/on-media) to consume.
3) The logical follow-up to points 1 and 2 is that you should be doing what you can to stop the consumption of porn (your own, first; then by your friends, and family, and the kids who get iPads before elementary school). You should be thinking about how to stop the trafficking of girls into the sex trade, and you should be thinking about how to destroy an industry that will continue to negatively materially impact women's lives. Building towards gender equality means eradicating the unhealthy notions propagated in porn, because it means eradicating the commonplace sexual violence women face in all facets of life.

In the words of [Emma Lazarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Lazarus), "Until we are all free, we are none of us free."

All that said:
- Sexuality is natural.
- Sex is a normal thing. Masturbation is healthy.
- Exposure to naked people, kissing, sex at relatively young ages is healthy (in healthy contexts).
- Some amount of natural exposure to porn in the past (eg. stumbling upon an old nude pinup photo in the woods) was probably somewhat acceptable. Looking through a saucy SEARS catalog was probably a good thing to do at 9 years old, as was holding hands with the people I liked. But there's a line that's been crossed, with the advent of technology and the progression of the porn industry. With all social media, the lines between real life and carefully crafted image is blurred. The lines between streaming in hot tubs on Twitch and going on TikTok live in a bikini and whatever technical definition of "porn" you have are becoming increasingly hazy as well. Droves of pornographic content is available on platforms that are commonly accessible by children, not to mention the open internet.
- Historically taboo topics must be broached with honesty and transparency in order to dispel outdated notions and ideals. We must be talking about this stuff, often and loudly, in order to help people understand the dangers of a widely-accepted, corporate-backed industry that's dangerous for everyone involved.
- You should talk to your friends about how to establish healthy friendships and partnerships. You should establish healthy support systems for yourself and for your friends.
- Talking about it more will allow you to make sure your friends are safe and doing well, and it'll give you more perspectives into how relationships should (and shouldn't) work.
- Being communicative with your partner (or potential partners) is the best way to ensure you're on the same page as them. Being communicative with your friends is the best way to ensure you're going through regular experiences and handling them in the best way possible for all the parties involved.
- Relationships (and time alone) are both learning experiences. You can learn a lot about people in any relationship. You can see how they think and what they care about and how they do things. You can emulate their strengths when you notice them; you can strive to avoid their weaknesses, when you notice something about them bothering you. You should be building yourself up through the relationship, and you should be helping your friends and partners do the same. Cover their weaknesses, maybe they'll learn how to cover yours.
- Keep [learning](/posts/on-learning) from all the people and relationships in your life. Keep [building new ones](/posts/on-uniting). Keep [working hard](/posts/on-organizing). Eventually, you'll be the person you want to be - and [you'll be confident and ready in all your relationships then](/posts/on-meditations).
