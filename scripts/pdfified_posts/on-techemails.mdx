From April 7, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/TechEmails/status/1585804674170355712)), between Elon Musk and Parag Agrawal, regarding Musk's acquisition of Twitter:

> Elon Musk:

>
> Parag Agrawal:
> > I want to hear all the ideas - and I'll tell you which ones I'll make progress on vs. not. And why.
>

>
> > You got it!
