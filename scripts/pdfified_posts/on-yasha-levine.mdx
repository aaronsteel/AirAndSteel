> All these American leftists who say: "We must critique China!" Americans have no political power over our own ruling class in our own society. So good luck with "critiquing China"—as if that's gonna do anything except feed into the elite-driven "War with China" campaign going now

> I'll just drop this here: Like all elite-driven xenophobic campaigns, this “China did it” propaganda wave displaces blame for domestic political problems onto an inscrutable, foreign enemy.

> Let me reiterate this simply for those who don't get it: We can't even convince our shitty oligarchic government to give us basic healthcare. So...focus on getting political power domestically, rather than projecting your political impotence on evil foreigners.
>
> Glad I was planning to launch a new limited series on the history of America's imperial propaganda machine. Time's ripe.
> > With this insane spook-fed propaganda "War With China" campaign converging on us, I'm glad I planned to start a limited series on http://yasha.substack.com on the origins of America's imperial propaganda machine—from the CIA in 50s Munich, all the way to Falun Gong and others today

> Let's be honest: No one in America or the EU actually cares about Belarusians. They just want to destabilize Russia. Unleashing a wave of desperate and exploitable migrant workers on the EU—and privatizing the country's vast industrial and ag wealth is a big bonus, too.
>
> AGAIN: NO ONE HERE CARES IF BELARUSIANS LIVE, DIE OR GET TURNED INTO SERFS ON A GERMAN FARM.

> Just look at what our empire helped do to Ukraine. What a nightmare. Today this highly-educated, resource-rich country — once home to the most advanced Soviet industries — is the poorest country in Europe.

> this whole masked help/servant “scandal” is so perfect. people suddenly upset because servants have to wear masks—but not because there are servants who constantly live and work under the authoritarianism of their masters, i mean, employers. yeah the mask is the evil thing here.

> the met gala was egalitarian until the celebs and elites made their servants and lackeys wear masks!
>
> oh those hypocritical libs!
