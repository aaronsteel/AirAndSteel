## My thoughts on Voting and US Electoral Politics

- Communist and Socialist parties should run candidates if/when/where that's financially feasible and stands a real chance to win.
- Where that's not possible, Communists and Socialists should run in local offices and work to coalition build (ie. [unite](/posts/on-unity)) until it is.

- In the meantime, voting is quick. Imo, you should vote for the most progressive candidate likely to realistically win. Takes a few hours every season, if that.
- And resources are sparce. The Democratic and Republican establishments are both wings of ruthless capitalism and brutal imperialism. We should not be spending our resources giving money or time to parties who unilaterally allow misery at home and endorse it overseas.
- Vote for whoever you want, or don't vote if you think that's the most useful use of your ballot. I'm not telling you what to do - though I do think some candidates (especially at local levels, in certain areas) are materially better than some of their opponents. And after that, go give a pair of socks to the guy on the street; read a [book](/posts/on-site-contents-by-topic); see if any of your friends want to go volunteering with you; reach out to someone you miss; lay down and vibe to some [music](/posts/on-music); go for a run, or a swim, or a climb. Don't waste any more time on US electoral politics than you have to, keep your eyes on the [prize](/posts/on-organizing).
