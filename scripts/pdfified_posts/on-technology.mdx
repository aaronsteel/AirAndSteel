### "Hint: it's a weapon"

---

> Never forget that technology is a weapon. If you feel the world is not as perfect as it should be, then you must struggle to put the weapon of technology at the service of society. You must rescue society before that can be accomplished, so that technology benefits the greatest number of human beings possible, so that we can build the society of tomorrow-whatever name you choose to give it-the society we dream of and that we call - as it was called by the founder of scientific socialism - communism.

– Che Guevara

> There is a weapon in this mural - a U.S.-made M-1 rifle. When it was in the hands of Batista's soldiers that weapon was hideous. But that same weapon became extraordinarily beautiful when it became part of the arsenal of the people's army.

– Che Guevara

> Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.

– Mao Zedong
