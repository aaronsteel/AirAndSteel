### Thread Four: Other Marxists texts which should be read - Mar 18, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/ScottishCommie/status/1504972185345183750))

> Going to make a thread here that will probably get expanded upon in the future of Marxist theory recommendations outside of the 5 heads. These are works I've either read myself or has been recommended to me by comrades. Unfortunately free links for these books I cannot find
>
> 1: [Blackshirts and Reds (via drive.google.com)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12ONHcu0qxTMb7FsnimD5PxNEC4Ou7zTA/view) by Parenti. Essential readings. Dispels a lot of anti communist propaganda and highlights the horrors of Capitalism.
>
> 2: Washington Bullets by Vijay Prashad. Outlines the history of CIA coups and assassinations around the world
>
> 3 & 4: Another View of Stalin by Ludo Martens and Stalin: The History and Critique of a Black Legend by Domenico Losurdo. Both books dispel a lot of the myths and propaganda around Stalin
>
> 5: Africa Must Unite by Kwame Nkrumah. It highlights the cause of the Pan-African movement, the movement to unite Africa under scientific socialism
>
> 6: Neocolonialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism by Kwame Nkrumah. Speaks on a new stage of imperialism. This book cause a massive outrage in the US for obvious reasons
>
> 7: How Europe Underdeveloped Africa by Walter Rodney. It goes into great detail on how Western Capitalist nations are the reason for Africa's lack of development
>
> 8: Discourse on Colonialism by Aimé Césaire. Highlights the horrors of colonialism and rejects the "justifications" for it
>
> 9: Black Marxism, the Making of the Black Radical Tradition. Unfortunately I haven't read it yet so I cannot describe it but it has been recommended to me by a lot of Comrades1
>
> 10: Women, Race and Class by Angela Davis. It covers Marxist feminism and the history of the slave trade and other Black and Feminist movements thought a Marxist analysis.

> Dialectical Materialism is just so interesting and once you grasp it's meanings and fully understand it, it's impossible to see things without it. I think for an introduction, Stalins ["Dialectical and Historical Materialism"](https://redsails.org/dialectical-and-historical-materialism/) is a great read.
>
> In the first Chapter "Marxist Dialectical Method" he mentions  four principal features. The first being "Nature Connected and Determined"
>
> The point here is that all of nature is connected to one another. You cannot understand things as isolated from one another. Everything is effected by one another. For example, a tree dying maybe due to a lack of rain or a lack of sunlight due to surrounding plants.
>
> It is not dying on its own. Furthermore the tree cannot grow on its own, it relies on the nature around it (water, soil, sunlight, etc).
>
> The second part is "nature is a state of continuous motion and change". 
What this means is things are not stagnating, everything is constantly changing. Plants grow and change throughout the years and throughout the seasons.
>
> Another example is you as a person. You do not stay the same, your mind and body changes as time goes on even at the molecular level. The cells constituting your body now are not the same ones you had at birth. Old cells die and new cells grow.
>
> It is the nature of all things to grow and change. To be born and to die. Nothing stays the same.
>
> The third point is "natural Quantitative change leads to Qualitative change" What this means is as more and more things occur (Quantitative change) a new Quantitative change occurs.
>
> An example would be water boiling. As the temperature increases (Quantitative change) this leads to a Qualitative change of the water boiling. Likewise a decrease in the temperature would lead to the Qualitative change of water turning into ice.
>
> A bigger example would be the Quantitative change of Strikes, Protests, Riots, etc leading to the Qualitative change of a change in legislature, president or even the Qualitative change in the mode of production via a revolution from Capitalism to Socialism.
>
> The final point is "Contradictions Inherent in Nature". This refers to how Contradictions exist within all things, there is a constant struggle between the old and the new, a struggle between opposites. Progress is driven by these Contradictions.
>
> New things grow out of the old. Feudalism was born out of antiquity, Capitalism was born out of Feudalism and Socialism was born out of Capitalism.
>
> To end off Stalin says that slow Quantitative changes leads to faster and abrupt Qualitative changes such as revolution resulting in the change of the mode of production. Therefore Capitalism can only be overthrown via Quantitative changes leading to a revolution.
>

> You don't need to kiss the ground they walk on, or even like them all that much. But this narrative that Stalin and Mao were mass murdering lunatics akin to or worse than Hitler just shows you've done 0 analysis of their works, both theoretical and practical.
>
> Did they do some shit that personally I don't like? Of course, no one will agree with 100% of someone's actions. Did they also leave their mark on the world that was a net positive? Absolutely. One must only look at their nations before they came to power to see the good they did
>
> And not just their nations. On the world stage their actions and the actions of their nations had profound effects mostly positive. If not for the USSR, the Nazis would have won WW2.
>
> It's also just extremely embarrassing to see this binary good or evil, and the narrative that Stalin and Mao were evil from self described Marxists. Gotta start gatekeeping the term Marxist until we figure out wtf is going on

> Upon looking into it I realized just how good the Cuban Healthcare system is and how much it contributed to the high life expectancy of the nation.
>
> Before the revolution, Cuba was led by a fascist comprador leader known as Batista who was eventually ousted by Fidel Castro, Che Guevara and the Cuban people.
>
> Under Batista there was at its height, 88 hospitals in Cuba, 9.2 doctors per 10000 people, and the country was ravaged by corruption, crime, and capitalism. The transformation that has occurred Post-Revolution is nothing short of fantastic.
>
> By 2019, Cuba had 150 Hospitals, 436 Community Polyclinics and 15,000 regular clinics. There is now 84.2 doctors per 10,000 people meaning that Cuba employs over 97000 physicians. Cuba also has 5.3 hospital beds per 1000 people, compared to the United States number of 2.87.
>
> Life Expectancy in Cuba sits at 78 years, and Infant morality is 4.2 per 1000 people (the lowest in North America). By 2025, they will have the highest proportion of people over 60 in all of Latin America.
>
> Cuba has not kept it's healthcare at home either as it currently has over 30,000 doctors working overseas. In 2004, Castro along with Hugo Chavez of Venezuela launched "Operation Miracle" which provided free healthcare for all illnesses affecting the eyes in Latin America.
>
> This led to 3.5 million people within Latin America having their eyesight restored free of charge. Cuba also started "LABIOFAM" in Africa, a chemical and biopharmaceutical research institute which is working to vaccinate Africans against Malaria which kills 630000 annually.
>
> They also set up ELAM, The Latin American School of Medicine which has graduated 20,000 doctors from over 123 countries. Ban Ki-Moon, former secretary general of the UN said it is the "World's most advanced medical school"
>
> Margaret Chan, Former Director-General of the WHO said in regards to the Cuban Healthcare System "Cuba is the only country that has a healthcare system closely linked to Research & Development. This is the way to go, because human health can only improve through innovation".
>
> They also congratulated the leadership of Cuba for "having made health an essential pillar of development". and further said "We sincerely hope that all of the world's inhabitants will have access to quality medical services, as they do in Cuba".
>
> In the face of Covid Cuba has made great strides. They have developed 5 separate vaccines for Covid one of which when combined with the booster vaccine Soberana Plus (also cuban made) was 91% effective. Transporting these vaccines elsewhere has been difficult due to the sanctions
>
> Cuba has fully vaccinated 9.94 million people in their country, or 87.7% of the population, one of the highest's in the world. They have also sent doctors around the world, particularly Africa to help fight covid such as sending 200 doctors to South Africa.
>
> Speaking of vaccines, Cuba has developed a lung cancer vaccine. Information is limited but it is said that it has greatly increased the life expectancy of people with Lung Cancer, even those with an advanced case.
>
> In clinical trials, those with an advanced case of Lung Cancer whom had been granted 9 months to live ended up surviving an extra 3 months with the vaccine. An increase of 25%. Again due to the embargo and sanctions, it has not left Cuba.
>
> Jack West MD, the clinical executive director for AccessHope and a medical oncologist at City of Hope who specialises in Lung Cancer said in regards to the vaccine "It seems to provide a very modest survival benefit".
>
> To end this off I shall leave you with two videos speaking on Cuba and its healthcare. One by [Kwame Ture](https://youtu.be/1OS8Z5B5Cbk) and one by [Michael Parenti](https://youtu.be/eoxT1UwTM3I).
>
> *EDITOR'S NOTE*: I subbed similar youtube videos for the twitter clips linked, watch on twitter for the originals if the website still exists.
>
> Just to add in regards to Covid in Cuba, Cuba has had 8500 deaths from Covid, Belgium, a country with the same population size as Cuba has had 31000 deaths despite being "more developed" and richer than Cuba

> The mass normalisation & love given to the Azov battalion in Ukraine by Western leaders & media outlets should deeply concern us. Its no secret that the west is friendly with Fascism but to openly parade nazis as heros is extremely dangerous and we've already seen consequences of this. The right is organised, the right in many nations is armed. And decades after decades of red scare propaganda has left the western communist movements in unfavourable positions to this. All I can say is get organised and if you can, arm yourself.

> Some so called Marxists seem to be trying to move away from any kind of social progressivism whether that be towards LQBTQ+ rights, women's rights, etc. The justification for this is that liberals, etc and by extension the capitalist system also "fights" for these things.
>
> First off this idea that social progressivism is somehow disconnected from the class struggle under the capitalist system rather than attached to it is deeply flawed. But secondly they're ignoring the fact that the right has historically always tried to coopt leftist movements.
>
> A big thing within Fascism is the use of leftist (mainly Marxist) language to gain popularity within the masses while quietly actually working against the pro working class agenda they talk about.
>
> Marxists do not need to distance ourselves from these struggles because they can be and have been coopted. What we should do however is to bring these struggles back to a Marxist base, to talk about them and fight for them through the proper analysis, a Marxist one.
>
> Things such as women's rights can be used as a means to justify western imperialism, we've seen this with Afghanistan and the fake outrage Western media had for how women will now be treated there. The truth is they don't care, its just a justification for the US to go back.
>
> But does that mean women's liberation is somehow bad? Of course not. Marxism from its inception has fought for women's liberation, we see this in the writings of Marx and Engels. Further writers, both male and female have continued this struggle.
>
> Do not abandon the working masses just because a part of their struggle has been coopted by the capitalist system, but instead drag it back to its proper place. A place of being attached to the class struggle and use it to fight against the capitalist system.

### The Grenadian Revolution - Jun 29, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/ScottishCommie/status/1542320718721044480))

> The Grenadian Revolution, a thread
>
> Grenada is an island in the Carribean. It became a French colony where the Native Carib and Arawak people were exterminated by French colonialists. African slave labour was brought over and the island became an agricultural colony. Eventually Britain took control of the island.
>
> In 1974 Grenada won its independence and its new leader was a man named Eric Gairy, who began a process of selling out the country. Businesses were sold off, profits landed in the hands of a select few and the nation was dependent on Canadian, British and US finance capital.
>
> Gairy used his power in the government to fight businesses that opposed his own interests, enriching himself and a select few. He also passed many measures to suppress the masses and formed a gang, trained in Pinochets Chile to harass and kill the masses and opposition parties.
>
> The mongoose gang in Grenada were notorious and brutalised the people even killing the father of Maurice Bishop, the eventual socialist leader of Revolutionary Grenada.
>
> To fight back against Gairy, two organisations, the Movement for Assemblies of the people under Maurice Bishop and the Joint Endeavour for Welfare, Education and Liberation under Unison White an came together to form the New Jewel movement, a Marxist-Leninist party.
>
> The New Jewel Movement spoke on why it took a Marxist-Leninist path and said they were inspired by the Black Power movement in the US, the anti colonial struggles in Africa and most importantly the Cuban Revolution which allowed them to see Scientific Socialism up close.
>
> The New Jewel Movement (NJM) showed an ability to mobilise the masses such as demonstrations with tens of thousands of people, working closely with the proletariat, unions and becoming the main opposition party.
>
> Gairy feared there'd take over and planned to assassinate them while he was in the US. However the NJM managed to seize power while he was away, mobilising the masses and seizing the Blue Army Barracks, and nations only radio station. They also arrested the mongoose gang.
>
> The revolution was bloodless. The NJM smashed the state machinery and formed a new one, a People's Revolutionary Government and formed the Peoples Revolutionary Militia to protect the nation.
>
> Grenada was a very poor and underdeveloped nation however so Maurice Bishop took inspiration from Lenins NEP. He nationalised what he could and allowed limited capitalist development supervised by the new government to build up the nations productive forces.
>
> Under the NJM, Grenada progressed and the life of the masses greatly improved:
> - all of Gairys oppressive laws were removed.
> - businesses would now recognised and respect unions and the right to strike
> - organisations such as the national women's organisation grew in numbers
> - councils were formed in neighbourhoods, workplaces and villages to get the people involved in the governance of the nation and to raise the political consciousness of the people 
> - GNP grew by 5.5% in the first year of the rev and 14% in the second year.
> - real wages grew by 10%
> - unemployment fell from 50% to 12%
> - massive land reform programmes were ushered in. Government had 10, year leases on unused land over 100 acres for agricultural uses.
> - low interest loans for farms expanded
> - four new agricultural universities were established
> - benefits for unemployed workers introduced
> - medical and dental care became free
> - new clinics and modern hospitals were built
> - secondary school became a right, free books, uniforms and hot lunches were introduced.
> - price controls on essential food items
> - 75% of families eligible for interest free loans and low cost materials to fix their homes
> - a housing plant was built to produce 500 prefab houses a year
> - 30% of workers tax exempt
> - retirement, sick pay, disability pay, maternity leave and pay introduced.
> - women guaranteed equal pay
> - laws to stop the sexual abuse of women introduced and enforced.
>
> Revolutionary grenada received support from many nations such as the USSR, Libya, Syria, Eastern Europe, the DPRK and most importantly Cuba who helped Grenada with its construction of a brand new modern airport.
>
> However Grenada was subjected to imperialist propaganda by the US. Reagan claimed the New Airport was going to be used as a staging base for a Cuban and Soviet invasion of the US and accused the government of human rights abuses.
>
> Despite the good work being done by the NJM, a group of ultras under a man named Bernard Coard, head of the military accused Maurice Bishop of Revisionism and of being a Cuban Puppet. They arrested Bishop and put him under house arrest.
>
> The masses outraged, marched and freed Maurice who along with other NJM members marched to Fort Rupert to confront Coard and try and repair the damage. When they arrived however, the military opened fire, killing many people
>
> Maurice and the NJM members surrendered to stop the bloodshed. They were taken inside the Fort and executed. To this day, no one knows where their bodies are.
>
> The US used this political instability as an excuse to invade. They killed 69 people including Cuban workers at the airport and overthrew what was left of the revolutionary government. The US laid the final nail in the coffin of the Grenadian Revolution.
>
> However do not despair as the work of Maurice Bishop, the NJM and the Grenadian masses lives on and shall inspire new generations to take up their struggle.
>

Reply from [@ScottishCommie](https://twitter.com/ScottishCommie):
