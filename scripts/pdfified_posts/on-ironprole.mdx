### "aka Red, aka Red Army Duck, aka Junkyard Duck, aka a comrade in the Washington area who's been very helpful towards my education."

As seen on [twitter](https://twitter.com/IronProle), working hard to keep his community fed, healthy, and growing with [From The Heart PNW](https://allmylinks.com/FromtheheartPNW).

Please look at the work they're doing to see how you can fulfil similar needs in your own communities. Please help support the work that these folks are doing, if you're able.

Apart from his thoughts on twitter, Red also recommended Activist Study â€“ Araling Aktibista (aka [ARAK](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55825394-activist-study-araling-aktibista)). It's a great read by the Communist Party of Philippines' Education Department, which you can read from [Foreign Languages Press](https://foreignlanguages.press/colorful-classics/activist-study-araling-aktibista-arak/) for free.

It's a great resource to get up-to-speed with Red's work and mindset, and I highly recommend checking it out as well.

I'm going to post some of the things I've learned from Red. His outlook on life and his role within it have shaped my understanding of what a comrade should do; of what a comrade does.

I don't have too much of it documented, many of his thoughts may become hard to find with the passage of time. I am absolutely thankful for the learnings I've been able to take from him so far, and his spirit will live on in the work all of us continue to do. I believe, fundamentally, we share a [purpose and attitude](/posts/on-organizing).

More than anything, it's been a pleasure to witness some of the beauty of humanity within a comrade I respect dearly. I strive to live a life as meaningful as his, and I work each day towards that effort.

## Your first job ([src](https://twitter.com/IronProle/status/1367948751453655043))

> Your first job in guerrilla warfare is to survive.  The fight is long, and the fire is hot.  We dont need to run to a flame that's already headed our way.
>
> Prepare yourself for survival and you are preparing yourself for success.
>
> Running toward the fire because you are bored or guilty or for some other secondary reason is for you, not for the People.
>
> Discipline, Frugality and Humility are the ways of the guerrilla warrior.  You survive so you can serve.

## Build a world worth living in. ([src](https://twitter.com/IronProle/status/1584717008415096832))

> The Marxism I practice has no room to tell anyone that their pain is not real that that their palliatives are not useful.
>
> Change minds by making a world worth living in and nobody will retreat from it, nobody will seek out such palliatives.
>
> Change conditions and minds will change with them.  Heal the leg and the opiate is no longer required.
>
> First things first.
>
> If your Marxism is one of judgement and moralizing, of penalizing and crushing, it is not one that we share in common.
>
> We stay armed with compassion, with constructive works and with a focus on reducing harm.
>
> Build a world worth living in.

## Red's take on [understanding the river](/posts/on-siddhartha) ([src](https://twitter.com/IronProle/status/1583186938491961344))

> Once you stop trying to swim against the current and realize things are as they must and should be, everything falls into place.
> 
> No wishful thinking, no idealistic daydreaming.  No false hopes.  Just concrete actions and clarity of purpose.
>
> I could wish things were easier, or i can make them easier for someone else.
>
> I can wish i had a mentor or i can be that mentor i wish i had.
>
> I could hope for long life or i can help build longer lives for those who would otherwise be lost.
>
> Life is as it must be. It is the only way it could be.
>
> From there we can move toward changes that matter. From there we can create history.

## First-Things-Firstism ([src](https://twitter.com/IronProle/status/1583308752627044352))

> First-Things-Firstism
>
> Fill Bellies.
> Mend Bones.
> Settle Minds.
> Throttle Aspirations.
> 
> If nothing else this should be what you remember from me.
> 
> Put first things first.
>
> The first three are self explanatory but the fourth always gets me questions.
>
> We mean that we encourage people with aspirations to advance their profession or their studies to do so, even over the street work, so they can bring their skills back to the work.
>
> You want to get a MD?  focus on your studies and give us only your freest time.  Get your grades, pass your exams and bring it back to the streets.
>
> Your skills, knowledge, expertise and your newfound income will help the movement.
>
> You wanna be a lawyer?  Do it we support it, so you can bring that advantage to the people and their needs.
>
> Its cultivating people and their abilities, building potential for the movement and splitting valuable labor from the exploitation of the owners.
>
> We must be developing our forces at all times and all hands are needed.  This fourth point is the longest looking one of the pack, the one that requires a firm rooting in place and time.
>
> But it is crucial to our long term success that we have our own experts.
>
> So instead of going for that better paying job on the east coast, we need to capture that expertise.  Maybe they take the lesser job in order to continue serving the people.  Maybe they forgo some of that aspiration and join us once more in service at the street level.
>
> This is what it means to throttle aspirations.  Not to kill them, in fact to support them, but to limit their usefulness to the bourgeois and maximize their value to our neighbors.
>
> In this way people fulfil themselves and each other effortlessly.

## More book recs from Red ([src](https://twitter.com/IronProle/status/1571685222475005954))

> [How To Hide An Empire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121985-how-to-hide-an-empire), [How Europe Underdeveloped Africa](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40630.How_Europe_Underdeveloped_Africa) and [Wages of Destruction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/711592.The_Wages_of_Destruction) are three must reads for greenhorns.  If you want to have an informed viewpoint on the history of colonialism.  It doesnt stop there but its a great start.
>
> The author of HTHAE, Immerwahr, is pretty spicy and has some occasional chuckle worthy moments when he finds creative ways to describe US settlers.
>
> HEUA, written by Walter Rodney and Angela Davis is data driven history that never stops blowing your mind at the sheer monstrosity of European colonialism.
>
> I forgot to add [Open Veins of Latin America](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/187149.Open_Veins_of_Latin_America).  A brutal and eye opening book along the lines of HEUA, very data and fact heavy.  A necessary read.
