### "ie. I'm an engineer and I'm serious about it."

What are `[scientists, engineers, organizers]` after?

Perfectly directed effort, optimal placement in the current given scenario. To understand the problem and relevant environment; to exert control over enough relevant elements in order to achieve the desired outcome.

---

What does this require?

Organization.

- Scientific research and experimentation to determine the nature of a given scenario (ie. science).
- Problem solving, building, and further experimentation (ie. engineering).
- Discipline in work, learning, improving; focus on proper efforts and bridge-building; clarity in mind and in work; a virtuous seriousness, in all efforts and endeavors (ie. organization).

What is organization?

Organization is seriousness.

It is building. It is maintenance. It is crafting the environment towards desired ends. It is iteration.

It is clarity and thoughtfulness - in understanding, in planning, in communications.

It is analysis towards a full understanding of the forces at play, the problems at hand. It is learning.

It is understanding your role on an ongoing basis; constantly striving towards the optimal trajectory, always course correcting.

It is playing to your strengths while improving your weaknesses.

It is calculated action with perfected timing.

It is knowing who to look towards in a given situation; building strong safety nets; finding worthwhile leaders and role-models.

It is clarity in purpose. It is revolutionary optimism, the optimism of the will despite the pessimism of the intellect.

It is knowing that the only way is forward. It is knowing the only thing to do is buckle down and get to work. It is iteration after iteration after iteration, until you win or until you can't.

What is antithetical to organization?

Sloppiness, flippancy, a lack of direction, doomerism, dogmatism, wasting time, carelessness, listlessness, slowness.

It is giving up. It is throwing away the world we seek to gain.

It is the unseriousness - the lack of discipline - that allows for the destruction and decay of everything that matters.

You say you'd like to get organized? You say you care about the future? Then let's get serious.

Do the reading; do the work; take care of yourself (and your people) in order to fight again tomorrow.

They'll find me drowned or they'll find me thrashing. Head down, working hard - until reality disallows it.

PS. This is also the purpose of this site. Organization for me (helping organize my thoughts and compile my resources) and organization for you (figuring out your role, helping guide you towards the most effective ways that you can help yourself and your communities).
