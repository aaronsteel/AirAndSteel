Don't have a full article on Palestine yet but I saw a tweet and wanted to make a quick note.

## Reading

[Strategy for the Liberation of Palestine (via foreignlanguages.press)](https://foreignlanguages.press/colorful-classics/strategy-for-the-liberation-of-palestine-pflp/) was published by the Popular Front of the Liberation of Palestine in February 1969. A pdf is available there, physical copies are available on FLP or on [RedPrintsPublishing](https://www.lulu.com/shop/popular-front-for-the-liberation-of-palestine-and-marxist-leninist-reading-hub/strategy-for-the-liberation-of-palestine/paperback/product-zqy9pp.html?page=1&pageSize=4).

### Intellectual Front for the Liberation of Palestine - Nov 12, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/IntellecFront/status/1591452987897294849))

From [@IntellecFront](https://twitter.com/IntellecFront)

> Over 70,000 bullets and 70 grenades were stolen without detection from an IOF base in the occupied Syrian Golan today. Earlier, 30,000 bullets were stolen from an IOF base in the Naqab. These bullets will surely make it back to the IOF, at a speed of approx 2,600 ft/second.

This type of resistance, this type of armed resistance, draws strategic and tactical parallels from guerilla warfare of the past. I highly recommend reading [Mao](/posts/on-mao) and [Che](/posts/on-che) on Guerilla Warfare as well as the PFLP's take on Liberation Strategy in Palestine.
