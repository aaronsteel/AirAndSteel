## Tweets

For what it's worth, Aaron's constant suspensions and bans are one of the first experiences I had with the [Fall of Twitter](/posts/on-the-fall-of-twitter). It does give me some hope that I'll continue to find rational, intelligent voices if I keep looking for them (though it's sad that so much of what he's written has been lost to questionable censorship and artifically-barricaded bits). I'll post a few things, but these are all recent because I can only grab stuff from his most recent account.

> the A.I. art trend is disconcerting ngl. the very idea that some people think you can reproduce something that comes from a base of human experience & social life (art) but without any of that stuff involved in the process, makes me question what they ultimately think of people
>
> its one thing to automate physical labor. i think pretty much all menial physical labor should be automated if possible. but to automate creative labor robs art of what makes it art - people
>
> im also not ringing alarms bells that A.I. art will replace artists. i dont think it will (i could be wrong). but the fact that people think it can & *want* that to happen does not bode well for society in deeply felt indescribable ways
>
> i hate doing threads & i wish i was more succinct in my first post but if it wasnt clear im not worried about the novelty of emerging technologies or that A.I. art is replacing artists right now. im talking about the devaluation of people

> went from "essential workers" to forcing people back to work under worse conditions & pay, & then when people start unionizing & striking all of a sudden a manufactured recession is necessary. lol this shit is so fake

> fucked up how conservatives & liberals have goaded people into thinking material issues like trans rights & black liberation are "culture war" issues & leftists eat that shit up as if dignity & self-expression are merely aesthetic nuisances
>
> there is no "culture war." the base is the present mode of production, everything that flows from that & reinforces it is superstructure. marxism 101 cmon son

> this is the best twitter has ever been. watching the richest man in the world (for now) squirm like a bug because hes too dumb & proud to admit paid verification was a bad idea is better than when trump got covid
>
> consider that trump is still alive. chilling. gearing up to run again. elon musk just blew through mountains of cash while pissing everyone off & is posting through it
>
> this is also the greatest time for parody posting ever, pissing off some of the most evil people & corporations who are sure to be mad at him too

> the musk-twitter saga should be instructive, proving once again that billionaires are morons. plain & simple. yet there are people who will blame twitter employees or wokeism & maintain that he will lead us into the future. these people are also morons & unsalvageable
