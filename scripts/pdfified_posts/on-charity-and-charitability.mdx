### "Be the helper."

---

Rather than looking for a charity to donate to, I've found it useful to rather be charitable in all the situations I find myself in.

Mr. Rogers always said to "Look for the helpers" and I found that advice very meaningful growing up. But it's time to set the example while looking for the role models to emulate; it's time to be an emulatable example yourself. As I've grown into an adult, I've tried to _be_ the helper in as many situations as possible.

Or, if you prefer [Marcus Aurelius](/posts/on-meditations) to Mr. Rogers:

> Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one.

Generating goodwill is a powerful thing. We should be gaining the masses to our side.

From each according to ability - you should be giving a lot if you have the ability to do so. We should be seeking to provide for everyone who is in need.

I'll share a few stories of ways I've found to be charitable in the recent past here.

## Dropped Jacket and Picking Platforms
### Oct 05, 2022

Two cool things happened today.

First, at lunch, a couple kids were running past me in midtown. One of em had an open backpack and his jacket fell without him noticing. I yelled, "hey kid, you dropped your jacket!" and luckily I was able to get his attention. And in front of me, a nice lady picked up the jacket to hand back to the dude as he ran back to grab it. It was a nice moment; I'm glad the kid didn't lose the jacket.

Then, after work while waiting on the subway, a lady approached someone for help. The other party was on their phone and unreceptive, but I had glanced up and smiled when she walked to our area. She came to me next, and she asked if I could help. Her accent seemed somewhat French, but I couldn't tell for sure. I assured her I'd give it my best shot. She asked if I knew which side of the platform she had to get on if she was going to Times Square. It was an easy ask - she wanted a Brooklyn-bound train, as opposed to the Queens-bound I was waiting on, and I told her as such. That was a nice moment too; it felt meaningful being able to help her, even in such a small way.

## Spotted Lanternflies and Big Macs
### Nov 04, 2022

I went out for a walk a few minutes ago. As I exited my apartment, I noticed a spotted lanternfly crawling in between the doorbell and the doorframe, in a crevice too small to thwack with a shoe.

I didn't really look around, the street is always busy, I just thought "I hope nobody thinks I'm some sorta sicko" as I slipped off my right shoe and felt the cold concrete under my right sock.

I waited for a little. I always consider the fact that these creatures are merely fulfilling their design, propagating as imbibed into their nature. I consider that they've done no known wrong as I take their lives and end their ability to invade our shared earth. I rarely watch lanternflies move, I'm always quick to the draw. But I saw it feel the cracks in the brick, I saw it move carefully towards the sky. There's deep and beautiful intricacy to all animal movement, which I sometimes forget to observe in the creatures I've abstracted as dead-on-sight.

When it moved far enough from the doorbell, I swat it once. As it fell to the ground, I double tapped it, harder, at its landing spot.

While I was kneeling over the dead lanternfly, my shoe an inch above it in my hand, a young girl, maybe 12, maybe 14, addresses me: "Hey sir, do you want this Big Mac? I'm just not hungry" as she holds out a familiar cardboard box.

I'm flustered, I hadn't expected human interaction at that moment; I had just inflicted death upon the world. I half laughed and said "no thank you! have a good day though." She had kind eyes, I don't know why she stopped at me specifically. If she stopped a moment later, I probably would've taken the sandwich - I was leaving to forage for sustenance, I'm starving at this very moment.

But she'd have found someone who wants her sandwich in a moment if she asked a bit further down the block, there's enough hunger to go around. It was a nice gesture to see from someone so young; in her way, she was providing what little she had. I appreciate that. I like seeing kids who care about the world, I think she demonstrated some of the great beauty in humanity in what was clearly an awkward and slightly uncomfortable gesture from her. I hope she keeps trying to help others in the future, as should we all aspire to do.
