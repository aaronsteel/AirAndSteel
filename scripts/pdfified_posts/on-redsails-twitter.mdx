### "Lots of stuff Nia and Roderic posted"

TODO: combine with RedSails page? Separate between Nia/Roderic? idk maybe do something.

## Nia Frome

Buncha her tweets. I'll probably make a separate page, or maybe tack it onto the [RedSails one](/posts/on-redsails).

### Marketing Socialism - Jan 31, 2019 ([src](https://twitter.com/NiaFrome/status/1091004191022202880))

This eventually became an article on RedSails, [Marketing Socialism](https://redsails.org/marketing-socialism/), but I saw it on twitter first.

> when i was a kid i also believed 'communists should ditch that label, for PR reasons'. now i think you make more headway owning it than dishonestly disavowing it. not least because *someone will almost always bring up stalin no matter what you call yourself*
>
> stalin is a powerful trope for normies. his name stands for the perverse emergence of injustice from the overzealous pursuit of justice. it's dramatic irony. it's a morality tale about how power corrupts.
>
> that mythic trope stands as a barricade between normies and socialism *no matter what kind of spin you put on socialism*
>
> what are the crimes normally attributed to stalin? the show trials, the purges, the gulag, forced collectivization... in other words state violence. the socialisms that define themselves in opposition to stalin therefore downplay state violence as much as they can.
>
> but statehood IS (a monopoly on legitimate) violence. the question of who's doing violence to whom, and to what end, is the fundamental problem of politics. it's capitalism's answer to this question that makes us hate it so much.
>
> "nobody does violence to anybody" sounds good, but it's not actually a political position. political positions require charting out a plausible path from where we are now into the glorious future ahead, and that path goes through socialist states.
>
> the demonization of stalin is the demonization of socialist statehood itself. you will not convince a normie that the latter is false as long as they remain convinced that the former is true.
>
> the ritual denunciation of stalin on "the left" 1) presents a utopia of socialism without antagonism 2) flatters first-worlders and academics 3) spares people the unpleasantness of interrogating how their ideas about the past were formed 4) makes a virtue of losing and waiting
>
> if we decline to draw from the entire history of socialism-in-power in favor of utopian socialism or pragmatic liberalism, the range of results we can obtain will be limited to those achieved by utopian socialism (evanescent communes) and pragmatic liberalism (hellworld)
>
> pretending our new thing is sui generis and doesn't have anything to do with bad stalinism *doesn't actually mean we'll face different problems or have better solutions*. stalin faced problems that were generic to socialism. socialism isn't just a label, it's a class project.
>
> you don't actually transcend that project just by calling yourself something else, just like you don't transcend capitalism by calling yourself a post-capitalist.

### Why is Materialism Proletarian? - Jul 15, 2021 ([src](https://twitter.com/NiaFrome/status/1415685579430371328))

> why is materialism proletarian? because the objective world exerts a greater unifying force on the thinking of the proletariat than it does on the thinking of any other class. the bourgeoisie, a minority, can more easily wrap itself in myths and delusions of grandeur
>
> i think that, in an important sense, proletarian standpoint epistemology = materialism
>
> so wherever marxism becomes massive it becomes more materialist, more marxist
>
> the material world is what we share, ineluctably. the urgency with which it presses itself upon our thoughts is inversely proportional to our insulation against it, insulation in the form of money/power/privilege
>
> liberalism is a marvelous technology for sparing the bourgeoisie the unpleasantness of having to synthesize or hash out their various conflicting worldviews, it's a license for boundless subjectivism
>
> *because* each bourgeois can be counted on to step forward when it counts, that is, to defend their class interest in maintaining exploitation, keeping their insulation nice and thick, there is no need to reach any higher agreement on an objective basis
>
> the proletariat, which needs cooperation to survive, which is brutally exposed to the exigencies of life on this planet, can't afford to leave conflicts unresolved, it *needs* objectivity
>
> the proletariat as a class has more sense organs and greater sensitivity to the material world than any other class in history

### Problems - Aug 2, 2021 ([src](https://twitter.com/NiaFrome/status/1422056559132258308))

> capitalism creates problems that only socialism can solve. socialism is inevitable only in the sense that a logical conclusion is inescapable, not in the historic senseâ€”it is of course possible that humans won't solve their problems

### Pessimism and Nostalgia - Oct 23, 2021

> it's bizarre to see tankies accused of both pessimism and nostalgia when like... we're the ones who think socialism is winning
>
> eschatological optimism is no optimism at all
>
> and if you've had the misfortune of speaking to an anti-stalinist leftist for more than two seconds you know they're giant fucking nerds about what could have been, that's their bread and butter
>
> similarly w/r/t the idea that we're only in it for the affective payoff of taboo-breaking, as if there were no affects associated with the anti-stalinist left (getting off at being smarter and more decent than everyone in history, potentially leading the "true" revolution, etc.)
>
> evidently some important taboos need breaking, also
>
> in general the psychologizing argument that paints your enemy as unwell, moved by pathological motives, can basically be turned against anyone, and is therefore abstract, empty. what matters is the *content* of the hope, the *content* of the nostalgia, *which* taboos get broken

### iPhones - Nov 8, 2021 ([src](https://twitter.com/NiaFrome/status/1457783112444698624))

> re: the "you're a communist with an iphone" thing 
>
> communists are the ones who believe that the incredible wealth of our society, though the product of heinous exploitation, should be made to serve the great masses, that capitalism has made unprecedented things possible
>
> the WHOLE POINT is to detourn, hijack, repurpose, salvage, adapt these things that are the product of class society in order to bring about a classless one. you don't DO that by keeping your hands off all the dirty products of class society (i.e. basically everything)
>
> furthermore:
> > the most ethical consumption would be to buy clothes handmade by versace himself
>
> the contradiction between being a communist and having an iphone is the contradiction between use-value and value at the heart of the commodity itself
>
> the law of value or abstract labor is a kind of monstrous drive to accumulate coupled with a monstrous indifference to concrete particulars. use-value, by contrast, is *all about* concrete particulars - if you want people to flourish, you want them to enjoy use-values.
>
> the underlying problem is that we produce stuff in this anarchic, clumsy, uncoordinated way, that our labor is socialized only after the fact, and so the law of value runs roughshod over everybody's flourishing
>
> making a socialist society means reasserting the sovereignty of conscious deliberation (the kind of thing iphones are very good at enabling btw) over and against the unconscious rule of blind economic forces

### Replacements - Nov 27, 2021 ([src](https://twitter.com/NiaFrome/status/1464721319426236426))

> whatever replaces capitalism has to be better than capitalism *at* doing stuff, not just better in an abstract/moral sense
>
> protracted economic war

### Race - Dec 30, 2021 ([src](https://twitter.com/NiaFrome/status/1476604613717540870))

> it's a race between socialism and human extinction

### Anarchism or Socialism? - Jan 24, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/NiaFrome/status/1485680106844700672))

> there's definitely an asymmetry between MLs and anticommunist leftists: MLs can explain anticommunism as stemming from propaganda, ignorance, and social pressures, whereas anticommunists can only explain marxism-leninism by saying that a lot of people just choose evil
>
> this has to do with the fact that we have more experience being them than they do being us

### Moving to the left - Feb 9, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/NiaFrome/status/1491470985626894342))

> you move to the left as you gain an awareness of crimes that are much worse than theft and murder: big, abstract crimes of using many people wrongly, squeezing them dry, denying them access to the means by which they might flourish, frittering away their lives on stupid nonsense
>
> all the baby-brained rightists can do is dial up the made up death toll of communism because they haven't progressed beyond like stage 4 of moral development
>
> i wasn't sure about this tweet because like, if you think about it, both the preconventional stages 1-2 and the conventional stages 3-4 are really just punishment avoidance, minor variations on what is essentially stage 1 thinking

### Markets - Apr 13, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/NiaFrome/status/1514323213047799818))

> the claim "markets are incompatible with socialism/communism" conflates two questions:
>
> 1) are markets a feature of communism? (no) 
>
> 2) must markets disappear immediately in order for something to be recognizable as socialism? (no)
>
> once again, by erasing any distinction between lower and higher, socialism and communism, ultras can revoke the socialism card of any society that has ever existed and render the term completely speculative, imaginary, philosophical, ideal
>
> eschatological

### Consistency vs Completeness - Oct 22, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/NiaFrome/status/1583992142225022977))

> locality/consistency/non-contradiction
>
> realism/completeness/holism
>
> you gain the latter only by sacrificing the former, with which it's mutually exclusive
>
> realism â‰ˆ holism because realism says there's only *one* objective world (that's what objectivity means, the oneness of it, there not being as many worlds as there are perspectives) and that means realism hinges on counting the whole world *as* one, i.e. holism
>
> locality â‰ˆ non-contradiction because it has to do with a subjective narrowing of one's focus (*only* in the sense x, *only* meaning y) with the *goal* of attaining consistency, self-identity, for one's objects. the worst slur a dialectician knows is "partial, one-sided"
>
> sorry to break it to you but the interdependence of all things got in there before your little controlled experimental setup and it ALWAYS WILL

### Imagining - Oct 31, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/NiaFrome/status/1587230560476340225))

> the correct form is the imperative: stop imagining the end of the world, start imagining the end of capitalism

### Understanding - Nov 1, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/NiaFrome/status/1587508187229573121))

> understanding stuff in a more proletarian way = understanding it better
> 
> this is because our *existing* understanding is so deeply biased by accumulated historical privileging of aristocratic and bourgeois perspectives

### Nov 3, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/NiaFrome/status/1588220817317453825))

> re: idealism vs. materialism, philosophy, the ivory tower, anti-intellectualism, kant vs. dogmatism, credentialism, communization of the epistemic, etc.
>
> the basic question: "who has the right to truth?"
>
> one answer with obvious appeal: "everyone!" but that can't be right, because people disagree. unless somehow our notion of truth could encompass those disagreements? but then it would no longer point in any particular direction, it wouldn't resemble *objective* truth at all.
>
> there's going to have to be some kind of hierarchy, some axis by which we measure who's closer and who's farther away from the truth. perhaps multiple axes? that sounds nicely pluralist, but again it waters down our conception of truth to the point where it can't do what we want.
>
> so you're gonna have to bite the bullet and admit that truth is unevenly distributed. the obvious next question is: who's got it?
>
> oops, there's been some drift from the first tweet. "who has the right to [declare or discover] truth" has turned into "who's got truth?" before i was talking about inequalities in its production (permits), now i'm talking about inequalities in its possession (poverty/wealth)
>
> so we could side with those who aren't allowed to declare or discover truth, or we could side with those who are richer in truth
>
> the obvious dialectical temptation is to come up with some sort of reasoning to show that these are in fact the same people
>
> oh wait i've already done that:
> > understanding stuff in a more proletarian way = understanding it better
> >
> > this is because our *existing* understanding is so deeply biased by accumulated historical privileging of aristocratic and bourgeois perspectives

### "Modern" Tendencies - Jul 30, 2022 ([src](https://twitter.com/RodericDay/status/1553578289230487552))

> An interesting thing about studying theory instead of just being born again every Thursday is that you can see how, far from fresh, many of these "modern" tendencies are just remakes:
- Maoists are Proudhonists
- PatSocs are DÃ¼hringites
- SocDems are Kautskyites

### MediaList - Mar 2, 2021 ([src](https://twitter.com/RodericDay/status/1366960353205231617))
