## On Debs

This'll be a (real) page at some point, with more info about Debs and that era of history. But for now, just some quotes off twitter.

> The capitalists are combined against you. They are reducing wages. They have control of the courts. They are doing everything they can to destroy your power. You have got to follow their example. You have got to unify your forces.

> Your grandfather made a pair of shoes, and they were his own. You make a thousand pairs of shoes where he made one. You do not own a single one of them. You can produce wealth in fabulous abundance, but you have not got it. Why not?

> You are satisfied with too little. The average worker with a wage that will keep body and soul together is content, and he is told that he is blessed to be content. Iam doing what little I can to incite him to discontent. Intelligent discontent is the torchbearer of civilization.
