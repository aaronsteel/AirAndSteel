TODO: Religion is the opiate of the masses quote, explanation

There are material factors around your time of birth. Those born next to Christmas may have unique experiences around what they do for gifts, maybe they receive fewer gifts. People who enjoy their birthdays in the summer may develop a strong affinity for the beach; those in the fall for halloween or candy apples. There are environmental factors surrounding birth that lend themselves to real, material trends observable in people.

One interesting example of that sorta phenomenon is present with why high schoolers look older in photos from decades past [link Vsauce video].

I'll be frank: most astrology is garbage, imo. But people like it because it gives em some reassurance or hope or guidance or gossip in their lives. It's fun for some.

There are lots of old ancient pieces of wisdom, from the native Americans to the Chinese centures BC. Eastern cures and herbal remedies, misunderstood by the West. There's meaning in putting positive intentional energy into things! There's a reason placebos work! If it's a placebo at play making things better, then let em have the placebo!

In the same vein, I'm not quite religious. I believe in the material reality we live in, and that's about it. And I think many religious institutions have caused immense harm, there are bad paradigms that crop up in organized religion. But there are many good religious people, there is positive to be found in religion. Sikhism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Christianity all posit positive ideals and encourage positive growth. Many people are saved by religion, religion can help people grow into more positive members of society. Islam helps guide fighters in intifada resistance, in uprising against oppression. Many people are able to find community through religion. Try to foster support, reach out to people within these groups. Show them where you agree with them; maybe show them where you disagree too.

Where young men have been indoctrinated by misleading authorities (ie. false prophets) like Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson, understand that their willingness to accept those leaders stems from their isolation, loneliness, and depression. They are willing and ready to fight to improve their situation how they know how; we must show them why hating women and minorities isn't the right answer, we must explain the historical perspective of women and demonstrate their analogous struggles. We must connect the young men with women of all generations to correct misled ideals. We must get them to consume better media, stay away from too much Breaking Bad and pornography [Porn - andrea dworkin].

We must do the same with young women. Though I don't have an inherent women's perspective - though I do not personally know what it's like to be a woman - I learn from as many women I can. Young women would do well to find understanding of young men, learn how to handle those situations with care alongside vigilance. [Slave and master are both awkward in each other's presence - author? Kwame Ture? Fanon?] - We must work towards equality, which can only happen by taking conscious steps towards fully understanding the inequalities and finding the right ways to erradicate them. [Women hold half the sky - Mao, Sankara]

We must do the same with the elderly and the middle-aged, we must show them how times have changed; we must demonstrate the changing conditions in our world (look! they're all around). We must teach the old dogs new tricks, because they've got useful wisdom and experience and we want that on our side - we can all learn from each other. Fix their outdated perspectives, and learn history to better understand what you haven't experienced yourself.

We must foster growth with every demographic. Find out how disabled people are struggling. Listen to what kids are troubled about; they're learning from every minor thing around them, they need good guidance. Look at the animals around you - you can't speak to em, but figure out if they're surviving, look at how their lives have changed with the development of society. See what they need too.

If God exists, God exists within every man and woman and person around. within every disabled person, trans person, child. within every convict, within every sinner, within each vice. within every rat and cat and pigeon and worm. If you believe humans are formed in the image of God, you can see God's work in the roads and buildings we build, the churches and the schools and the big tall towers that get higher every day. God is found in the sun, in the rocks, in the water. In the wind, and in ripe tomatoes, in juicy oranges, and rotting mushrooms. In the litter, in the cigarettes, in the microplastics that seep into our bodies. In the music and the laughter and the sobbing. In the smell of chocolate, in the warmth of a hug. If we are all God's creations, then our legacy is God's work; what we do is what God is doing.
[Siddhartha rock quote]

If you believe in God, then grow flowers in the earth and build our reality forward in God's image. And if you don't believe in God, well, try not to be too harsh towards those who find meaning in a different way; you may as well grow the flowers too.

So, sure, I'll let the Astrologists have their fun. We have enough in common. Lmk what Aries are supposed to be up to these days, maybe I'll get some good use out of it.
