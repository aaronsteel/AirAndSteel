# On Covid

## 2022-12-03

### "The (Ongoing) Pandemic."

---

Alright. This post is going to be a composite of:

- current world data links
- links to current thoughts from doctors/etc about what people should do (ie. wear an n95 or better mask, especially when you're around other people who may need to be there to survive - they could be immunocompromised or otherwise vulnerable)
- strategies used around the world and results
- personal thoughts re ^

TODO: all that, and maybe more

### Keep yourself safe - Oct 19, 2022

From Eniko '[cohost.org/eniko](cohost.org/eniko)' Fox ([@Enichan](https://twitter.com/Enichan)) [here](https://twitter.com/Enichan/status/1582858520101548032)

> For anyone who needs to hear it: you don't have to be immunocompromised to keep yourself safe from covid, you can do it simply because you don't want to get or pass on the virus that gives people brain and cardiovascular damage. It's ok to not want that
>
> It's especially okay to not listen to anyone who keeps insisting you don't need to mask anymore because frankly anyone who does that does not have your best interests at heart

### Covid Denialism - Sep 29, 2022

From [IronProle aka Comrade Red](/posts/on-ironprole) ([@IronProle](https://twitter.com/IronProle)) [here](https://twitter.com/IronProle/status/1575596877227380736):

> Mfers need to stop trying to sell me on covid denial because im dying.
>
> I still have comrades and family i want to protect.  I still have time i want to spend.  I dont want to occupy my last days sicker than i need to be or infecting someone else.
>
> Sickening attitudes.
>
> I still have my values, my principles, that center my larger community and its long term needs.
>
> Im not a coward or a liberal.  I dont have a fake outter shell of compassion and consideration that falls away when i have nothing left to worry about personally.
>
> Thats disgusting.
>
> Im going into the grave with a mask on, covid free.  Knowing i did my part in life to protect the lives of others in every single way i could muster, large or small.
>
> Im willing to die bleeding on barbed wire for you, why not mask up?

From Dr. Claire Taylor ([@drclairetaylor](https://twitter.com/drclairetaylor)) [here](https://twitter.com/drclairetaylor/status/1534659652901822465):

> Covid is a vascular disease 🩸. We need to stop thinking of it primarily as a lung 🫁 disease. I hear lung Doctors says ‘we don’t see much on the chest X-rays in #longcovid’. The rheumatologists say ‘we don’t see raised inflammation on the blood tests in #LongCovid’
>
> the cardiologists say ‘we don’t see much myocarditis in #LongCovid and when we do it’s mild’. The GPs say ‘ we see lots of odd chest pain after Covid but we don’t really know what it is’.
>
> the media say ‘Covid is mild, long Covid is a mystery and we don’t know what causes it or how to treat it’.
>
> I say- Covid is a virus that causes vascular damage and inflammation. I say the ‘odd chest pain’ is not a mystery and neither is #LongCovid
>
> why do I say that? We now know that the blood tests we do in the NHS only show a tiny % of the immune system. We are testing the wrong markers. In studies Interleukins and cytokines ARE raised. [Clinical characteristics with inflammation profiling of long COVID and association with 1-year recovery following hospitalisation in the UK: a prospective observational study (via thelancet.com)](https://thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(22)00127-8/fulltext) #Covid_19 causes inflammation. No mystery.
>
> Now to more exciting stuff. Covid causes micro clots 🩸 with amyloid. Yes amyloid. They block capillaries and reduce oxygenation. Here is a photo of a patient’s  blood before Covid and afterwards when they got #LongCovid showing new microclots. [Persistent clotting protein pathology in Long COVID/Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) is accompanied by increased levels of antiplasmin (via cardiab.biomedcentral.com)](https://cardiab.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12933-021-01359-7)

>
> why is it not on the front pages of the newspapers? Why hasn’t our health secretary mentioned it? Why doesn’t your Doctor know about it? Why don’t they know that ‘normal’ bloods in Covid don’t test the whole immune system and for microclots? These would be good questions
>
> #LongCovid is a post viral illness. Therefore it has not surprised me today to see the pre-print showing the same microclots in #MECFS [The occurrence of hyperactivated platelets and fibrinaloid microclots in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) (via researchsquare.com)](https://researchsquare.com/article/rs-1727226/v1) This will not show up in blood tests done currently for #MECFS or #LongCovid resulting in ‘but your bloods are normal’
>
> Hopefully this thread might convince you Covid is more than a cold. That Covid causes vascular complications.That doing the usual tests won’t show you the problem. That when you apply cutting edge science to medicine you find answers. #MedTwitter #LongCovid #MECFS #TeamClots
>
> > Medical science has proven time and again that when the resources are provided, great progress in the treatment, cure, and prevention of disease can occur.

> 34 Damage from repeat infections is cumulative
>

>
> 56 No one wants lockdowns
>
> 57 Different covid strains have different symptoms and effects, some are more dangerous than others, none are mild

> 93 Covid causes deaths for longer than 28 days, so 28 day stats are an ineffective guide
>
> 94 The debate about being hospitalised 'with or from' covid is often a deliberate distraction.

> 95 Catching Covid while in hospital is not beneficial for inpatients
>
> 96 Practising healthcare workers do not necessarily keep up to date with latest research on covid or guidance on protective equipment and mitigations
tern
>
> 97 Vaccines on their own are not enough to stop this pandemic
>
> 98 Evidenced data on the effects of covid is readily available and can be found with little effort

> 99 More is being learnt about Covid by  serious researchers every minute
>
> 100 There was nothing beneficial about a covid infection before vaccination, and there's nothing beneficial about a covid infection now

>
> 120 Some people, for example the immunocompromised, do not respond to vaccination in a way that will mitigate infection, and run a high risk from infection
