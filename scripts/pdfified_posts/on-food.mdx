### "Keep well stocked and ensure others are getting enough."

I stay well-stocked on food and necessities, to the best of my ability. I keep healthy food around, easily accessible. It helps me build good habits.

It's easier to eat a healthy afternoon snack if there's an apple right in front of you. It's easy to stay happy on the go if you've got a protein bar, a bag of cheez-its, and a banana in your backpack.

And I've found where I am, currently, my backpack has to be resupplied often. Very often, I'm able to give food to people on the [subway](/posts/on-charity-and-charitability) or on the street. A bag of clementines is $2.50 and there are way too many to eat alone, I hand em out if ever someone looks like they could use em. There's something romantic about the smell of peeling an orange, I try to share the moment of peace.

My purpose is simple in most of these posts. I want you to cultivate positive environments for yourself, make it easy for yourself to succeed. And if you're doing well, help others do the same - many are struggling. A spare clementine can be the difference.
