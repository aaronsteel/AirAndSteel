## Kids

- Avatar the Last Airbender

This was a great show for me growing up. I think there's also a somewhat valid interpretation as anti-communist propaganda (ie. there are some amount of [swerves](https://redsails.org/the-swerve/), there are some unsatisfying explanations of incentives involved, there's a bit of anti-authoritarian/[brainwashing](https://redsails.org/masses-elites-and-rebels/) rhetoric, there's not enough decolonialization, they don't abolish the existing power hierarchies that led to vicious imperialism, ...). But especially as a kid, I think the values showcased really helped me. These include:
- Aang's personal perserverance and dedication to others (ie. the survival of humanity)
- Zuko's ability to redeem himself in the eyes of himself and his uncle, despite his earlier personal shortcomings
- Iroh as a general mentor figure, using his experience as an imperial leader to now fight with others across nations against the imperial expansion of the fire nation from his vantage (and always offering helpful advice over a nice cup of tea).
- The overall emphasis on teamwork throughout the show
- the focus on maintaining balance (between the elements, between nations, between the physical and spirit worlds, between La and Tui - spirits of the Sun and Moon, etc.)

I think it's a 70/30 type show, much better than it's bad. I think it promotes positive growth in children, and it should lead them to better ideals - hopefully they'll continue on to better media as they grow. But it's the best show I know for children off the top of my head, still a story of working together to stave off evil and disaster.
