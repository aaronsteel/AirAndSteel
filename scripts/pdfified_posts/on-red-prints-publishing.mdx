I was introduced to all of these efforts via twitter. Comrade Duck ([@DengistDuck](https://twitter.com/DengistDuck)), a [CPUSA](cpusa.org/join) member based in Laos who helped with the creation of MLRH and RPP; the reason I know about all the good work being done in the first place! Keep it up, comrade.
