## Alec Karakatsanis

[@equalityAlec](https://twitter.com/equalityAlec), bio [here](https://civilrightscorps.org/alec-karakatsanis-founder-executive-director/) on his site Civil Rights Corp.

He's had a few good threads, so I'm keeping this as a tracker to remember his writing and work.

> [THREAD](https://twitter.com/equalityAlec/status/1588210962867314689?t=ap1BwHhUCvqQoNg4pRBtbw&s=19). Two Harvard professors published an academic article calling for 500,000 more armed cops, who they say will arrest 7.8 million more people per year. The article reveals alarming flaws in elite academia at a time of rising fascism. This is one of my most important posts.
