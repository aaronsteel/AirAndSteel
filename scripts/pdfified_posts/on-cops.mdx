For now, I'll talk about a few links I've got bookmarked.

[This](https://www.wnyc.org/story/citing-drugs-rikers-nyc-ban-incarcerated-people-getting-letters-mail/) story, headlined "Citing drugs at Rikers, NYC to ban incarcerated people from getting letters in the mail", speaks about correction commissioner Louis Molina citing "fentanyl-soaked childrenâ€™s drawings, love letters, prayer schedules, and T-shirts" as rationale behind NYC banning incarcerated people from getting letters in the mail. As [David Kaib](https://twitter.com/DavidKaib) says on [twitter](https://twitter.com/DavidKaib/status/1585764778550562816):

> This is an obvious lie in service of doing something indefensible. That prison and jail officials lie so blatantly and that journalists treat those lies as true is disgusting.
