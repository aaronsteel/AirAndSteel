### "with Peter (@The_Law_Boy), Michael (@_FleerUltra), and Rhiannon (@AywaRhiannon)"

---

[5-4](https://www.fivefourpod.com/) is the only podcast I really listen to. It's a good look into the US legal system, and the folks are funny. I learned about em via Peter on Twitter. For now, I'm mostly just going to backup some tweets if I find any. But check out the pod, it's a good one!

> this is imo largely distinct from the phenomenon of wealthy liberals fretting over crime in cities, which is primarily the result of them being pussies

> every conservative whining about this is speaking entirely in abstraction. some intangible and unquantifiable damage was done to the court. can someone explain what specific problems this would lead to?

> sorry, but protesting outside of justices' homes is not the right way to voice your disapproval of the court.  the proper course is to pour billions of dollars of dark money into building institutions that steadily subsume the judiciary over the course of several decades

> when discussing the propriety of protesting outside of supreme court justices' homes, it's important to remember that in the 90s the court held that protesting outside of the homes of **abortion clinic employees** is protected by the first amendment
>
> there's been chatter about 18 U.S. Code § 1507, which seems to make protesting outside of a judge's home illegal. i'd think that if protesting outside of some random clinic employees' house is protected, so is protesting outside of the homes of powerful public figures

> what seems like an unprecedented deluge of lies and misinformation from the Uvalde police is actually a pretty standard amount of dishonesty from cops. they're just not used to anyone analyzing or questioning their narratives
>
> this is also why police departments will often seem shockingly bad at putting together plausible stories -- it's just not a skill they ever really need, because every political, cultural, and legal institution gives them the benefit of the doubt no matter what

> outcome aside, the fact that the jury for one of the most widely publicized trials in recent memory was not sequestered is unreal
>
> lots of people responding with "why should taxpayers have to pay for that??!" and i'm a big proponent of fiscal responsibility, so i suggest paying for it by firing one police officer
>
> there were steps the judge could've taken to make this less of a media circus, but you can't have it both ways. if you bring in the circus, you need to at least attempt to keep the jury impartial. instead we got a result that was probably dictated in no small part by youtubers

> I've been a vote-blue-no-matter-who guy for 22 years and now I'm feeling ready to check out of politics. Maybe that's not a character flaw in me but rather a reflection of party leadership that has been fucking up over and over for 20 years continuing to do so right now

> The risk of COVID being fatal to you or a loved one is obviously high enough that it should be motivating people to do all the precautionary stuff but I just want to reiterate--from a young otherwise healthy person--how much I feel like having COVID really fucked with my brain

> Attention span is decreased. My memory sucks. I have trouble finishing sentences, especially when I'm using specialized vocabulary. I have to read words and sentences repeatedly to actually "get" them. I was sick in mid June. I don't feel like I ever fully recovered.

> I don’t have undergraduate loans. I have $220K in law school loans. My initial balance was around $195K.
>
> I went to a public law school. No scholarships. I’m the 1st lawyer in my fam, one of the few to ever go to college. I graduated in 2016. My salary at my 1st law job was 52K. I did not break over 60K in salary until last year, when my income started to be supplemented by a podcast
>
> To qualify for public service loan forgiveness, you have to make 120 on-time payments and work for the “right” kind of public service organization that qualifies. That’s *ten years* of making payments every single month AND working for the right organization (501c3 or government)
>
> In solo practice doing legal work for the poor? Nope. Even though I’ve been practicing 6 years, I only have ~5 years worth of payments because I didn’t work for the right kind of employer (I worked for myself exclusively representing indigent clients).
>
> Extremely common

> > I went to a public law school and took out 140k. After paying down 40k i now owe 220k. Make it make sense.
>
> I make more money at my job now, but that’s as a result of a lot of external factors I had no control over (and am grateful for!)—i work for a new PD office that hired *six people* out of many many applicants, and we have pay parity with the DA’s office (🙄 whole nother rant)
>
> I will survive. But just wanted to provide my situation as an example. This is the status of most of the lawyers i know. You’re told “oh you’ll get loan forgiveness for public interest” like it’s nbd, like it’s nothing. I had absolutely no background knowledge or info

> Police put a woman in a car. And left it on the train tracks. And a train hit the car.

> Short thread. I made a really hard decision a couple weeks ago. I resigned from my job as a public defender. I have been experiencing serious mental health struggles for a long time, and in place of taking care of myself, I tried to take care of clients.
>
> I have spent a long time identifying as a public defender, so long that it’s hard now to think of myself as anything but. I can’t think of anything else I want to do other than fight for poor people in the system. If I’m not advocating on someone’s behalf, what am I even doing?
>
> I’m heartbroken. I worked with incredible colleagues, lawyer & non-lawyer warriors who make you proud to show up at work every day. The clients. The families. It was an honor to stand next to, to spend time with each and every one of them. Everything I saw. Everything I learned.
>
> I don’t know what’s next for me. I need to take care of myself & heal. This was a deeply personal choice, and i think that part—that it’s utterly internal, that my brain stopped working in the way I wanted, that there’s no one to blame—makes me feel selfish and guilty.
>
> Maybe we’ll talk about this on the pod soon. Maybe. There’s a big hole in my heart. “It is our duty to fight. It is our duty to win.” I’m going to try to apply this to myself, so I can show out for the people again one day soon. It is our duty to fight. It is our duty to win. ❤️
