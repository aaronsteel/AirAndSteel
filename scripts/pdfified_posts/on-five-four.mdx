### "with Peter (@The_Law_Boy), Michael (@_FleerUltra), and Rhiannon (@AywaRhiannon)"

---

[5-4](https://www.fivefourpod.com/) is the only podcast I really listen to. It's a good look into the US legal system, and the folks are funny. I learned about em via Peter on Twitter. For now, I'm mostly just going to backup some tweets if I find any. But check out the pod, it's a good one!

> sorry, but protesting outside of justices' homes is not the right way to voice your disapproval of the court.  the proper course is to pour billions of dollars of dark money into building institutions that steadily subsume the judiciary over the course of several decades

> when discussing the propriety of protesting outside of supreme court justices' homes, it's important to remember that in the 90s the court held that protesting outside of the homes of **abortion clinic employees** is protected by the first amendment
>
> there's been chatter about 18 U.S. Code ยง 1507, which seems to make protesting outside of a judge's home illegal. i'd think that if protesting outside of some random clinic employees' house is protected, so is protesting outside of the homes of powerful public figures

> what seems like an unprecedented deluge of lies and misinformation from the Uvalde police is actually a pretty standard amount of dishonesty from cops. they're just not used to anyone analyzing or questioning their narratives
>
> this is also why police departments will often seem shockingly bad at putting together plausible stories -- it's just not a skill they ever really need, because every political, cultural, and legal institution gives them the benefit of the doubt no matter what

> lots of people responding with "why should taxpayers have to pay for that??!" and i'm a big proponent of fiscal responsibility, so i suggest paying for it by firing one police officer
>
> there were steps the judge could've taken to make this less of a media circus, but you can't have it both ways. if you bring in the circus, you need to at least attempt to keep the jury impartial. instead we got a result that was probably dictated in no small part by youtubers

> I donโt have undergraduate loans. I have $220K in law school loans. My initial balance was around $195K.
>
> I went to a public law school. No scholarships. Iโm the 1st lawyer in my fam, one of the few to ever go to college. I graduated in 2016. My salary at my 1st law job was 52K. I did not break over 60K in salary until last year, when my income started to be supplemented by a podcast
>
> To qualify for public service loan forgiveness, you have to make 120 on-time payments and work for the โrightโ kind of public service organization that qualifies. Thatโs *ten years* of making payments every single month AND working for the right organization (501c3 or government)
>
> In solo practice doing legal work for the poor? Nope. Even though Iโve been practicing 6 years, I only have ~5 years worth of payments because I didnโt work for the right kind of employer (I worked for myself exclusively representing indigent clients).

> Short thread. I made a really hard decision a couple weeks ago. I resigned from my job as a public defender. I have been experiencing serious mental health struggles for a long time, and in place of taking care of myself, I tried to take care of clients.
>
> I have spent a long time identifying as a public defender, so long that itโs hard now to think of myself as anything but. I canโt think of anything else I want to do other than fight for poor people in the system. If Iโm not advocating on someoneโs behalf, what am I even doing?
>
> Iโm heartbroken. I worked with incredible colleagues, lawyer & non-lawyer warriors who make you proud to show up at work every day. The clients. The families. It was an honor to stand next to, to spend time with each and every one of them. Everything I saw. Everything I learned.
>
> I donโt know whatโs next for me. I need to take care of myself & heal. This was a deeply personal choice, and i think that partโthat itโs utterly internal, that my brain stopped working in the way I wanted, that thereโs no one to blameโmakes me feel selfish and guilty.
>
> Maybe weโll talk about this on the pod soon. Maybe. Thereโs a big hole in my heart. โIt is our duty to fight. It is our duty to win.โ Iโm going to try to apply this to myself, so I can show out for the people again one day soon. It is our duty to fight. It is our duty to win. โค๏ธ
