Tweetdump from Aren LeBrun, aka [@ProustMalone on twitter](https://twitter.com/proustmalone) and [@arenrlebrun on tiktok](http://www.tiktok.com/@arenrlebrun).

I found his thoughts/threads compelling, and I looked towards his [bookshelf](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62454238-aren-lebrun) to understand where he was learning from. He explicitly pushed his audience towards Michael Parenti, who I've covered [here](/posts/on-parenti) - for that, I'll always be grateful.

> I want to like Bernie Sanders, I really do, but I can’t help but notice that he’s causing poor people to act very angry and confident now rather than be quietly resigned to the depravities of capitalism the way I’ve grown to enjoy.
>
> Our system is not an accident. It is not a product inherited by otherworldly design. It is a direct consequence of daily human choice. Billionaires choose to hoard the wealth of a thousand lifetimes while sitting idly by as people starve to death every day all around them.

David Roth ([@david_j_roth](https://twitter.com/david_j_roth)) tweeted:

> Republicans asking to exempt the largest and most profitable companies on earth from providing paid sick leave during a pandemic is one of the most Republican things imaginable, and Democrats capitulating to Get Things Done is one of the most Democrat things imaginable.

to which Aren replied:

> The question isn’t, ‘Are there no major differences between the parties?’ but, ‘Do the differences make a difference?’

> The forced end of Bernie Sanders’ campaign was not the end of revolution in America. It was the end of negotiation.
>
> There’s not a magical 1:1 relationship between Bernie Sanders and these protests. Many of these people presumably (and understandably) don’t care much about electoral politics. But the radical ferment Sanders was tapping into is the same basic energy fueling this social rupture.

> The US education system isn’t designed to train people for a life of thought and investigation. It’s a tedium endurance regimen that helps stymie the suicide rate in an industrialized economy. Kids get tested on Steinbeck at 10 and are punished for still thinking about him at 11.

> If you happen to like any of my posts on here, most of the reason why is due to a colossally important Marxist writer by the name of Michael Parenti. A lot of people message me looking for reading recommendations. To all of you: I cannot recommend Parenti enough, especially now.

Legitimately a life-changing tweet. Thanks again, comrade. Since 2020, I've come up with my own thoughts [on Parenti](/posts/on-parenti).

> It's time to get military recruiters the fuck out of our high schools now.

> And while we're at it, it's time to set our political sights on nothing less than the full abolition of poverty in America, because hunger, hopelessness and desperation are the best military recruiters of all.

> Noncommittal Preening Republicans
>
> Public radio is a vital service and it’s one I support completely. But NPR is not public radio. It is a soothing chorus for liberals who do not know their calming, educational drive to work every morning is being orchestrated by the ideological tyranny of corporate capital.
>
> I’ve listened to NPR for years. Like all corporate-funded media outlets, not once did its coverage call into question the imperialistic drive of US foreign policy decisions. Such a glaring omission of critical questioning is not “objectivity,” it’s bias in favor of the powerful.
>
> NPR’s rep as a liberal outlet can only exist within an overall media universe that’s extremely far-right in its framing of economic and political policies.
>
> Think: NPR has a daily show called Marketplace. Does it have any companion program about the labor struggle? No.
>
> The omission of a real labor section in most corporate-owned MSM outlets (NPR included) is just one of hundreds of examples of the silent but powerful dogmas of “objective” centrism. These dogmas quietly dictate American audiences’ sense of what has news value and what does not.
>
> Why is it that there’s no dedicated Labor, Climate, Housing, or War section in any of our MSM outlets? These issues impact vastly more readers/viewers than the stock market does, but the latter gets more press than those previous 4 categories combined. That is a conscious choice.
>
> Why is it that so many Americans watch and read and listen to the news every day, and so few have even a decent understanding of capitalism or imperialism? Why do we have the most politically illiterate population in the world while having the most-watched 24/7 “news” of anyone?
>
> TLDR - If you’ve gone your whole life considering yourself fairly well-informed, and you’re not ignited with rage by the inhuman marauding our oligarchy has unleashed on foreign nations and its own people throughout this century and the last, NPR is likely a major reason why.

> A lot of talk on here about the “end of democracy” in America. I’m confused as to when the beginning of it was. The framers abhorred democracy and saw it (correctly) as a threat to the class privileges of rich landowners. That sentiment has carried straight through to today.
>
> The rich have always used false democracy to placate the multitude. James Madison, Federalist 10: “To secure private rights against the danger of [rebellion] and at the same time preserve...the form of a popular government is the great object to which our inquiries are directed.”
>
> Many Americans have a basic (if underdeveloped) awareness of how racist the founders were; far fewer understand how much they despised the unpropertied classes across all demographics. Hamilton said, “The [masses] are turbulent and changing; they seldom judge or determine right.”
>
> Elbridge Gerry (5th US Vice President) referred to democracy as “the worst of all political evils.” This he said amid the ongoing genocide of millions of native people in order to acquire the land and resources for the early development of American industrial capitalism.
>
> American history is littered with powerful voices admonishing democratic rule. Edmund Randolph, a US attorney who was the ninth governor of Virginia, said that the country’s problems were a consequence of the “turbulence and follies of democracy.”
>
> The Convention delegates in Philadelphia debated hotly for weeks about the wording of the Constitution. But it was not a democratic debate between rich and poor; it was the factional squabbling of merchants, slave masters and manufacturers vying to defend their holdings.
>
> Our government was instituted as the rich person’s equivalent of a union. It existed to serve the interests of the privileged class, not least of which was protection from a landless multitude whose appetite for liberty was not satisfied by the pretentious screed of landlords.
>
> A Twitter thread is not the place to detail every piece of evidence that proves this argument. For more, read Howard Zinn’s “A People’s History of the United States” and Michael Parenti’s “Democracy For the Few,” both still legal only because very few decide to read them.
>
> Maintaining the illusion of democratic rule has been an essential piece to the overall maintenance of the American empire as it has developed through the centuries. The ruling class in this country (yes, there is a ruling class) has done what it wants from the beginning.
>
> All the various iterations of progressives and socialists who’ve developed in America through the generations to resist the dominant capitalist orthodoxy arrive at the same conclusion: democratic freedom means nothing in a system designed to impose economic tyranny on the masses.
>
> All of this is to push back on the liberal argument that workers ought to support a system of rapacious exploitation, corporate monopoly, and genocidal market expansion in order to preserve some rhetorical gimmick that gives the system a legitimacy it’s never deserved.

> I’m sorry your mom died of COVID and you’re living with two roommates out of a 2006 Nissan Pathfinder ransacked nightly by Walmart’s private security forces as California burns to ash an acre per second on the horizon but have you considered there’s a CHEETO IN THE WHITE HOUSE

> If I were a salaried Vox reporter I would spend more time asking why only two Democrats voted “No” last week on the 161st judge Trump has appointed to a district court than I would about the 1.07% of the popular vote Jill Stein got four years ago.
>
> Let’s simplify this for the highly respected political pundits among us: If you believe someone is an “existential threat to our democracy,” you do not vote to confirm their judicial appointments.
>
> Again for the highly respected political pundits in the room: If you believe someone is an “existential threat to our democracy,” you do not vote to give them a $738 billion war budget and the permission to militarize outer space.
>
> And a third time to the highly respected political pundits, who are so full of shit they’re tripping on it: if you believe someone is an “existential threat to our democracy,” you do not vote to fund his anti-immigrant gestapo.
>
> I am of the opinion that pundits who spend more time attacking people without power than they do questioning people with it are  weasel-brained narcs who don’t deserve your attention unless it’s to dynamite their takes into oblivion and laugh at the debris.
>
> Also, for the sake of interest, it was Chuck Schumer and Richard Blumenthal who voted No on the judicial appointment. A few Democratic Senators abstained from voting, including Kamala Harris.
>
> In short: I criticize Democrats not because I believe Trump isn't a threat; I criticize them because I do think he is, and I wish they did, too.

> A lot of people describe our press as “free & open” because it is not owned by the state. They ignore that it is owned by six multinational conglomerates whose shareholders have a unified set of class interests that get reflected in nearly 100 percent of media coverage every day.
>
> A free press means more than Potemkin dissent from MSNBC and the New York Times. It means mainstream outlets critically questioning the economic and political order that rules our lives. There’s a reason Americans consume media 24/7 and know nothing about their country or world.
>
> It’s easy to find stories that criticize whoever the POTUS is at the time, because this form of dissent puts no stress on a corporate-capitalist worldview. Try finding one MSM outlet that reported accurately on the failed fascist coup to privatize Bolivia’s lithium last year.
>
> > “People who think they're free in this world just haven't come to the end of their leash yet.”

> Within the corporate-controlled media system there remain good journalists doing a good job. That's not the point. Ask yourself: Why are the most essential stories/themes of our time (climate change, imperialism, poverty and wealth, etc.) barely topics of discussion in U.S. life?

> The neoliberal ideal is inherently technocratic. People learn to be unconscious systems managers, viewing life as a network of rules and regulations divorced from any deeper moral character. This ideal worships codes and systems and numbs itself to the daily horrors they produce.
> 
> This is a major reason why U.S. liberals believe they are the good guys, fighting to restore "normalcy," while proudly supporting candidates owned by weapons manufacturers whose business model relies on flaying the innocent from machines that blacken the sky.
>
> This mantra might come from the powerful but it doesn't stop there. Log onto Facebook sometime and read the run of memes and whatnot of your more liberal-minded friends. The main theme is that Trump is a violation of the rules, not that the rules are themselves inherently fucked.

> The political content of these films is covert. Many of them feign critique of the state and the weapons industry. But never (ever) is the broader capitalistic purpose of imperialism brought into question. Per MCU movies, the system isn’t wrong, it’s just run by the wrong people.
>
> This is the perfect cross section of cancellability. Libs hate it because they need to believe imperialism can be morally virtuous as long as the correct heroes are in charge. Libs who call themselves leftists hate it because they think demanding smarter pop art is ableist.
