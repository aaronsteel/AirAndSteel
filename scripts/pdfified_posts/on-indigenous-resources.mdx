## Indigenous Threads

### New Amauta resources

From New Amauta ([@AmautaNew](https://twitter.com/AmautaNew)):

> In honor of Indigenous Heritage Month, I’m doing a 5 part outlining Indigenous ideologies! 
>
> For part 1, we’ll look at the ideology of Zapatismo from Mexico. A [THREAD](https://twitter.com/AmautaNew/status/1587654893908525056?t=tmtEfvI0I7KsyNoEQMGuVg&s=19)

Although I'm not posting the entire thread here, I'll post New Amauta's [linktree](https://linktr.ee/NewAmauta) which has his links on "Everything you wanted to know about Indigenous America (North and South)"

### Landback Resources

From Professor Flowers ([@LuaBorealis](https://twitter.com/LuaBorealis)) [here](https://twitter.com/LuaBorealis/status/1459572576456482821):

> I've been meaning to do this for a while. This is a compilation of some resources on land back that I found to be the most accessible. This is such an important topic, please take some time to look through these sources if you haven't already.
>
> The first source is a panel put on by 
[@LunaOi_VN](https://twitter.com/LunaOi_VN) and other indigenous people. They all share very informative perspectives on land back in different areas in the world. [Indigenous Panel Discussion on Decolonization and Landback (via youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6gJgoqVdg)
>
> The next are 3 short videos I've previously shared, that [@Wasiigan](https://twitter.com/Wasiigan) was kind enough to show me. They go over the inspirational land back movement in Canada:
> - [Past](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3sVg0Cvqh3k&t=42s)
> - [Present](https://youtube.com/watch?v=UsyyYeVHGJ0)
> - [Future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McVEgEA4qvg)
>
> I've also been shown the "The Red Paper" written by the Yellowhead Institute. It's brief, beautifully written, and a great overview of land back: [Land Back: A Yellowhead Institute Red Paper (via redpaper.yellowheadinstitute.org)](https://redpaper.yellowheadinstitute.org/preface/)
>
> Lastly here are a couple of books that [@AmautaNew] has suggested on learning about land back and Indigenous rights:
> - "The Red Deal" by The Red Nation
> - "New World of Indigenous Resistance" by Noam Chomsky, and voices from North, South, and Central America
>
> This is such an important topic. Please take some time to look into these sources if you haven't already.
