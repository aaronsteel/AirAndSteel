## LASD Gangs

The comrade who introduced me to All Power Books also introduced me to the following reading resource.

[A Tradition of Violence: The History of Deputy Gangs in the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department](https://knock-la.com/tradition-of-violence-lasd-gang-history/) is a 15-part investigative series by [Cerise Castle](https://knock-la.com/author/cerisecastle/).

It links [the LASD Gang Affiliate Database](https://lasdgangs.knock-la.com/), the first-ever public, searchable database of gang-affiliated LASD employees.

The series starts with [The Protected Class](https://knock-la.com/lasd-gangs-little-devils-wayside-whities-cavemen-vikings/): An examination of the first documented gangs in the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.

## Tankiepilled

[@TANKIEPILLED](https://twitter.com/TANKIEPILLED) is a comrade working at All Power Books who introduced me to their efforts. They led me to the LASD story when their twitter display name was "READ LASD GANGS" so s/o for that.

Here's a link to their [@whatsantifa linktree](https://linktr.ee/whatsantifa). It links to their [twitter (TANKIEPILLED)](https://twitter.com/TANKIEPILLED)/[insta (coffeenpedagogy)](https://instagram.com/coffeenpedagogy)/[tiktok (whatsantifa)](https://tiktok.com/@whatsantifa), as well as resources such as a [Marxism-Leninism 101 Guide](https://soyouwanttorevolution.carrd.co/), a [Viet Nam War Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nC6ZjKwN3NicV6z1PXcKoS6p-01rhEBQyJSynPtb6lE/), [Hồ Chí Minh on Black Liberation](https://www.workers.org/2018/02/35459/), [Hồ Chí Minh Primary Sources on marxists.org](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/ho-chi-minh/index.htm), and the [youtube link for "Gaza Fights for Freedom"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnZSaKYmP2s&ab_channel=EmpireFiles).

Kudos on the good work comrade; keep it up :4)
