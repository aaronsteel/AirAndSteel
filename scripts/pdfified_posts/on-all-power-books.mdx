## LASD Gangs

The comrade who introduced me to All Power Books also introduced me to the following reading resource.

[A Tradition of Violence: The History of Deputy Gangs in the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department](https://knock-la.com/tradition-of-violence-lasd-gang-history/) is a 15-part investigative series by [Cerise Castle](https://knock-la.com/author/cerisecastle/).

It links [the LASD Gang Affiliate Database](https://lasdgangs.knock-la.com/), the first-ever public, searchable database of gang-affiliated LASD employees.

The series starts with [The Protected Class](https://knock-la.com/lasd-gangs-little-devils-wayside-whities-cavemen-vikings/): An examination of the first documented gangs in the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.

## Tankiepilled

[@TANKIEPILLED](https://twitter.com/TANKIEPILLED) is a comrade working at All Power Books who introduced me to their efforts. They led me to the LASD story when their twitter display name was "READ LASD GANGS" so s/o for that.

Here's a link to their [@whatsantifa linktree](https://linktr.ee/whatsantifa). It links to their [twitter (TANKIEPILLED)](https://twitter.com/TANKIEPILLED)/[insta (coffeenpedagogy)](https://instagram.com/coffeenpedagogy)/[tiktok (whatsantifa)](https://tiktok.com/@whatsantifa), as well as resources such as a [Marxism-Leninism 101 Guide](https://soyouwanttorevolution.carrd.co/), a [Viet Nam War Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nC6ZjKwN3NicV6z1PXcKoS6p-01rhEBQyJSynPtb6lE/), [Hồ Chí Minh on Black Liberation](https://www.workers.org/2018/02/35459/), [Hồ Chí Minh Primary Sources on marxists.org](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/ho-chi-minh/index.htm), and the [youtube link for "Gaza Fights for Freedom"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnZSaKYmP2s&ab_channel=EmpireFiles).

Kudos on the good work comrade; keep it up :4)

> if u vacation in hawai'i after seeing natives beg tourists not to come, we are no longer friends and i am so serious about that. stand by your ethics.
>
> this is one thing that i can't wrap my mind around. many people who say they "support decolonization" or liberation at large but can't be bothered to just... not go there... and they still go?? your vacation is not that important in stark comparison to the negative impacts it has
